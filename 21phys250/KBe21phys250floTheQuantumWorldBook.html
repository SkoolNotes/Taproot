            <li><p>strong force holds quarks within the particle, and gets stronger as distance increases</p></li>
            <li><p>you can break a quark out of an atom, but the energy will become more quarks and antiquarks and you might get a pion out (bruh)</p></li>

            <li><p>the path tells us everything there is to know about a particle</p></li>
            <li><p>but at events (ex. where the path changes directions) any number of things might happen</p></li>
            <li><p>subatomic events seem to be instant and unsurvivable (nothing goes in and also comes out)</p></li>
            <li><p>particles can also move backwards in time, apparently</p></li>

            <li><p>every vertex has three points, with two fermion lines (particles) and one boson line (force carrier)</p>
            <ol>
            <li><p><strong>every interaction in the universe is the result of two fermions and a boson meeting in these triads</strong></p></li>

            <li><p>arrows denote anti-ness (a forwards-in-time positron is the same as a backwards-in-time electron)</p></li>
            <li><p>conservation laws are consistent at each vertex</p></li>
            <li><p>composite particles don’t interact with bosons, so we draw them as their constituent quarks</p></li>

            <ol>
            <li><p>gluon particles are determined by the quark pairs that they interact with? so a gluon being released and then absorbed by a diff quark essentially swaps the colors of the two quarks? <span><span class="smallcaps">question</span></span></p></li>
            <li><p>is there a difference between a red quark sending a blue quark a red antiblue gluon and a blue quark sending a red quark a red antiblue glueon? <span><span class="smallcaps">question</span></span></p></li>
            <li><p>quarks don’t change their type (up down strange charm top bottom) when getting glueoned</p></li>
