electricity! continue later..

## Continued, later.


unit of len?: newtons/coulomb -> $\frac{N}{C}$

no right len to draw, only relative 
in proportion to the ^2 of the charge 

assume pos point when defining electric field

infinite planes, ele fields are the same at any distance
"cone" of vision expands when u go farther away

remember || signs when doing comp!

arrow diagram show the path that a test charge would take, not the repulsion

```ad-question
can lines cross?
```

no. each test particles feel the net field. 

### path
- depends on
	- initial velocity
	- and force at time, f(t)
- if started at rest, then it will initially follow the electric field line, then we don't know because the info isn't shown?
- only guaranteed to follow the field line if the lines are parrelel away



```ad-question 
Estimate the total charge found in the protons of 1 kg of a typical metal. Assume that the mass represents 50% protons and 50% neutrons (electrons are pretty negligible in terms of mass). Each proton or neutron has a mass of about 1.67 x 10-27 kg (neutrons are slightly more massive but you can ignore the difference), and each proton has a charge of 1.6 x 10-19 Coulombs. 

Your Answer:

4.790419168 × 10^7
```


```ad-question 
What is the net charge of 1 kg of a typical metal? Explain why your answer is different from your answer to the previous question. 

Your Answer:

0, as the electrons would cancel the charge from the protons.
```


```ad-question 
In the first question of this series, you assumed that the material's mass was 50% protons and 50% neutrons. Is there an element or elements for which protons make up significantly more than 50% of the mass? For the most extreme case, what fraction of the mass is protons?  Is there an element or elements for which neutrons make up significantly more than 50% of the mass? For the most extreme case, what fraction of the mass is neutrons? Feel free to look at a periodic table, and limit yourself to naturally-occurring elements (that is, elements up to Uranium) in their most common isotopic state.

Your Answer:

Hydrogen has just a few more protons than neutrons.

Uranium has more neutrons than protons.
