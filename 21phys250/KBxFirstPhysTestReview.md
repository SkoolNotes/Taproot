## The cat, and Mary

seperation is one meter and charge is +/- one coulomb, the force is around 9 bil newtons
cat woudnt feel great...

```ad-question
why use this ungodly amount to define a coulomb?
```
open question


F=kq1q1/r^2
F>0 like charges
F<0 opposite charges

equations gives you a scalar, not directions. tells you if they attract or repel

electrons inside a conductor slosh around like a fluid

## If the charges on a conductor are stationary or static

electrons try to reach equilibrium
for them to be still, there must be no forces -> no e-field



## electric fields
- are perpendicular to the surface, and "skin deep"
	- charge is zero when u go in
		- except when charge is flowing

```ad-qoute
if charges are moving, all bets are off
```


fields curve near the end when fields on top arnt there to cancel

treat parrelel planes as infinite


## the pufferfish

gauss, the second.
gauss, the first, is in a drawer at lick

```ad-qoute
when your're dead you don't need friends
```
