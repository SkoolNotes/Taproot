# mechanisms of planned obscelescence

## contrived durability (key parts made out of eg. plastic)

## percieved obselescence: colors + shape changes

## systemic obselescence: ports / standards being changed

## programmed obselescence: dropping support for old versions

## bloatware obselescence: requiring vastly more hardware to make old devices slow

## legal obselescence: eg. emissions limits on cars

## repair prevention seals + screws

## repair preventaion construction (hard to access batteries)
