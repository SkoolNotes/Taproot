            <p>#source bulliet - Ottoman military was originally made of cavalry and Janissaries - Cavalry were paid with land, while Janissaries were paid with money. Janissaries were also more effective under devshirme - to regain land, government squeezed out cavalry - Inflation from south american silver also caused fixed currency peoples to struggle - all this led to revolt (cavalry + suddenly poor people) - Janissaries took advantage to make “Janissication” hereditary and marry/start businesses - Revolts + Ended up costing more -&gt; government struggling</p>

            <p>#source bulliet - European silver created a wave of inflation, where european traders had more silver than ottoman internal merchants - Safavid Iran also needed precious metals so they traded with the ottomans for it, which meant the ottomans had even hard money - Some use of copper coins which were inflation resistant?</p>

            <p>“kennedy said that the ming and the ottomans suffered the same downfall, and while they did both ultamately struggle due to spanish silver inflation and european traders, the inflationary loop started with emperors in ming china while the ottomans just kinda got stomped + janissaries weren’t vere patriotic”</p>
            <p>Although the economies of both the Ottoman and Ming empires suffered due to spiraling inflation and European trade, their misfortunes were not as similar as Kennedy suggests: the Ottomans’ overstretched military was undermined by Europeans trading silver while the Mings’ internal inflation spiral forced trade with and ultimately destruction by Europeans.</p>
