# WWI Results
Bellicist theory: centralizing impact due to the millitary and defensive imperitive; such as England, France

Reasons for state marking
1. To get more land!
2. To gain more economic advantage, and the US wanted free trade so they worked against them

## Statemaking by Decree
Europeans drew lines and created "mandate" states  — where states attempted to create an instable, dependent states.

**Imperalistic Mindsets**: states wanted to acquire land because land=security a la imperialism

**Economic Benifit**: control of key trading ports are benifitial for states welcoming of controlled trade

**Cultural Chavanism**: _white man's burden_

## States of Growth, Modernization Moment
* Traditional society => subsistence farming
* Conditions for take off => bulding infrastructure like transportation, monetary system, economy
* Take off => infrastructure and cultural boom
* Drive to maturity => new tech improved economy, infrastructure, etc.
* Maturity => trade expands, 小康

## Dependency Theory
**History matters and states don't exist in isolation.**

That "Britian and Brazil" are equally modern. That developing nations is just a part of world system of "modernity" and should not simply copy European nations to achieve growth.

Wall yourself off + protecting yourself from global market, and jusifies Socalism and Defensive Developmentalism?

## Cultural pessemism
Europe as the foustein man: rather than western civization is spreading to lift up, Western culture is actually a sickness that's spread across the globe to satiate the European drive and system.

Fashism responding to the crisis that individuals believed that liberal societies are in themselves a wrongness.
