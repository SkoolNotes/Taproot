# Evolution
*The unifying theory of all biology involving any change in the heritable traits in a population over a long period of time.*

**Causes of of evolution**
- different reproduction rates
- Environmental pressures
- non-random mate choices
- Migration

**Evidence for evolution**
- Lab evidence of short-lifespan bacteria
- Fossels and and DNA evidence

## Begin by defining evolution
=> Descend with modification

**Micro-evolution**: changes in alleal frequency within a population from one generation to the next

**Macro-evolution**: descend of different special from a common ancestry over much longer timescales

_Remember: evolution happens over **deep time** — much longer than your monkey brain could feasibly preserved_
