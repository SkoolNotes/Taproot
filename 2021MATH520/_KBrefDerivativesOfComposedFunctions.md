title: Derivatives of Composed Functions
---

When you have $$\begin{aligned}
x(t) = \text{ something }
y(x) = y(x(t))
\end{aligned}$$

then $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
\end{aligned}$$

because

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}
\end{aligned}$$ by the [chain
rule](~/projects/Taproot/2020MATH401/KBrefDerivativeRules.org).
