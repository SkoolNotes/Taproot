* witch of Maria Agnesi

  Let $B$ be the center of the orange circle with radius $a$, let $Q$ be the closest point to $C$ on the x-axis, and let $Q$ be the closest point to $A$ on the y-axis.
  
** $x(t)$
   
   \[\begin{aligned}
    \tan \theta &= \frac{\overline{CD}}{\overline{OD}}\\
    \cot  \theta &= \frac{\overline{OD}}{\overline{CD}}\\
    \overline{CD} \cot  \theta &= \overline{OD} \\
    2a \cot  \theta &= x
   \end{aligned}\]

** $y(t)$

   
   First, note that the distances
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \overline{AB} = \overline{BO} = a\\
   P
   \end{aligned}\]

   
   \[\begin{aligned}
   \angle AOB &= 90-\theta \\
   \angle OAB &= 90-\theta && \quad\text{(isocelese triangle)}\\
   \angle ABO &= 2\theta \\
   \end{aligned}\]

* swallowtail catastrophe curves
  Defined by 
  \[\begin{aligned}
  x &= 2ct - 4t^3\\
  y &= -ct^2 + 3 t^4
  \end{aligned}\]
** features
*** approaches a parabola-like shape above the y-axis
*** approaches a parabola-like shape below the x-axis if $c > 0$
*** has a cross-over in a triangle shape
**** gets bigger when $c$ gets bigger
*** it looks like a dorito that scales with the value of $c$
**** as $c$ approaches zero from the positive direction, the swollowtail gets smaller
* Lissajous Figures
  Defined by 
  \[\begin{aligned}
  x &= a \sin (nt)\\
  y &= b \cos  t
  \end{aligned}\]
** features
*** spring-like coil shape (almost like standing waves) with tighter "loops" at the ends
*** $a, b$ control the size of the coil (default $-1 \le x, y \le 1$ because of range of $\sin, \cos$
*** number of y-intercepts is $n+1$ except in the degenerate cases $n \le 0$
