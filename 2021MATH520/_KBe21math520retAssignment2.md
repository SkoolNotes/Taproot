# swallowtail catastrophe curves

Defined by $$\begin{aligned}
  x &= 2ct - 4t^3\\
  y &= -ct^2 + 3 t^4
  \end{aligned}$$

## features

### approaches a parabola-like shape above the y-axis

### approaches a parabola-like shape below the x-axis if $c > 0$

### has a cross-over in a triangle shape

1.  gets bigger when $c$ gets bigger

### it looks like a dorito that scales with the value of $c$

1.  as $c$ approaches zero from the positive direction, the swollowtail
    gets smaller

# Lissajous Figures

Defined by $$\begin{aligned}
  x &= a \sin (nt)\\
  y &= b \cos  t
  \end{aligned}$$

## features

### spring-like coil shape (almost like standing waves) with tighter \"loops\" at the ends

### $a, b$ control the size of the coil (default $-1 \le x, y \le 1$ because of range of $\sin, \cos$

### number of y-intercepts is $n+1$ except in the degenerate cases $n \le 0$
