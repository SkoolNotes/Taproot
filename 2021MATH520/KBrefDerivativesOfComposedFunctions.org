#+TITLE: Derivatives of Composed Functions

When you have 
\[\begin{aligned}
x(t) = \text{ something }
y(x) = y(x(t))
\end{aligned}\]

then 
\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}
\end{aligned}\]

because

\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dy}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}
\end{aligned}\]
