#+TITLE: Second Derivative of a Composed Function

Based on [[file:KBrefDerivativesOfComposedFunctions.org][derivatives of composed functions]].


\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx} \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\dot{x}\ddot{y}-\dot{y}\ddot{x}}{\dot{x}^3}
\end{aligned}\]

Where $\dot{x} = \frac{dx}{dt}$, $\dot{y} = \frac{dy}{dt}$, and $\ddot{x} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$.
