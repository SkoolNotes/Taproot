**** Eyes as bearers of memory
- AJ => dark memories as something her body (knee) forced into her mind (eyes)
- AK => the white men draining the eyes (memories?) of natives to include only drugs or alcahol
  
**** Society's air creates pressures
- AF => unlike the atmosphere, water moves (bubles rise) but Jaquie can't swim
- AD => pain as a pressure manifest in the atmosphere holding Jaquie down
- AN => air as something addictive, that provides temporary relief that also takes something from you

**** Society's drugs dulls pain
- AB => drinking as a form of slowing time
- AO => drinking as something dulling and "solemn"
- AR => systemic entertainment by the society (TV) favored by Jaquie over natural beauty
