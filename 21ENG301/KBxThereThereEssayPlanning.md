```ad-abstract
1.	**Prompt**: In his Prologue, Orange claims that “we are the memories we don’t remember, which live in us, which we feel” (10). Choose one character from the novel, and explain how he/she embodies, revises, or refutes this claim. Be sure to explain/define the quotation and how it connects to the character you are discussing.
```

		- you can reject reality (denial)
			- even if you don't know how it got there, you know what it is and can avoid it
		- you can change it (hope)
		- also, what was done to the ancestors (breadth)
			- not just "we are what our ancestors did," you are what was done to your ancestors

? "the sense that everything didnt come out"
