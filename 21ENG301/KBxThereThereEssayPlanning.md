```ad-abstract
1.	**Prompt**: In his Prologue, Orange claims that “we are the memories we don’t remember, which live in us, which we feel” (10). Choose one character from the novel, and explain how he/she embodies, revises, or refutes this claim. Be sure to explain/define the quotation and how it connects to the character you are discussing.
```

rough thinking: [[KBxThereTherePromptsAndQuestions]]

### Idea

- rough: we are not the memories we don't remember, we live in the memories we don't remember 
	- seems pedantic, but this small nuance has much broader implications
		- you can reject reality (denial)
			- even if you don't know how it got there, you know what it is and can avoid it
		- you can change it (hope)
		- also, what was done to the ancestors (breadth)
			- not just "we are what our ancestors did," you are what was done to your ancestors

? "the sense that everything didnt come out"

#### mapping
edwin:
- denial
	- internet obsession
		- second life
	- ? bill is both self aware and in denial
	- constipation represents how when in denial, he is stuck? cannot move forward?
		
- hope
	- getting better, working on the powwow
	
- breadth
	- shooting? reflects the past, points out that it's now about just about what you do, it's about what is done to you.

edwins arc maps to the revised point: "We live in the memories we don't remember"





### qoute bin 
- **main**
	- "But what we are is what our ancestors did. How they survived. We are the memories we don’t remember, which live in us, which we feel, which make us sing and dance and pray the way we do, feelings from memories that flare and bloom unexpectedly in our lives like blood through a blanket from a wound made by a bullet fired by a man shooting us in the back for our hair, for our hair, for our heads, for a bounty, or just to get rid of us."
	
- **denial**
	- "but I dream of the internet"
	- "I was really into *Second Life* for a while. I think I logged two whole years there. And as I was growing, getting fatter in real life, the Edwin Black I had in there, on there, I made him thinner, and as I did less, he did more."
	- "The Edwin Black in there had a job and a girlfriend and his mom had died tragically during childbirth. That Edwin Black was rained on the reservation with his dad. The Edwin Black of my *Second Life* was proud. He had hope."
	- "When I moved back in with my mom, the door to my old room. to my old life in that room, it opened up like a mouth and swallowed me."
	- "I read a lot and come away with nothing. This is how time skips."
	- "Remembering itself is becoming old-fashioned"
	- "And it reminds me how removed I am because of her."
	- "'Well, that's a pretty convenient theory for someone who spends twenty hours a day leaning into their computer like ther're waiting for a kiss,'"
	- 
	
- **hope**
	- "The trouble with believing is you have to believe that believing will work, you have to believe in belief."
	- "I have to give up."
	- "I feel something not unlike hope"
		- C: after connecting with dad, thinking about internship, life starts moving.
	- "'At least he's got a job now. He's working. Every day. That's a lot. For him. Please. I don't want to discourage him.'"
	- "Today means everything for them. The countless hours they out in. All the different drum groups and vendors and dancers they had to call and convince to come, that there was prize money to be had, money to be made."
	- "But this means more than a job for Edwin at this point. This is a new life."
	
- **breadth**
	- "'Whatever bro, my record keepers have it going down differently'"
	- "'That's their culture'"
	- "There's a gravity to it. A weight pulling him closer to Octavio, who's now pointing his gun at Edwin and Blue. He's pointing at the sage with the gun. He's calm about it. Calvin has his hand on his gun through his shirt. Edwin crouches down to open the sage."
	- Shooting descriptors..
	- "When Blue pulls into Highland, Edwin is passed out. She’d been telling him, yelling at him, screaming at him to stay awake. There was probably a closer hospital, but she knew Highland. She keeps her hand on the horn, to try to wake Edwin up and to get someone to come out to help. She reaches her hand over and slaps Edwin a few times on the cheek. Edwin shakes his head a little. “You gotta wake up, Ed,” Blue says. “We’re here.” He doesn’t respond."


### Outline

##### Intro: 
Not, we are the memories we don't remember, but we live in the memories we don't remember.
Ancestors -> ancestor experiences -> ancestor actions -> shape world -> shape us
ancestor experiences & actions = memories we don't remember in my model
While it sounds pedantic, it has much broader implications.

##### Denial
One cannot know what part of them stems from the memories we don't remember. Orange talks about these parts being the culture, but that can be rejected. One can't deny the memories because they are intangible, but one can deny reality. Updated model allows for choice.

##### Hope
One can't change what happened in the past. But, one can change the world, can change where they live. We are not *just* the memories we don't remember. We are also the memories we do remember!

##### Breadth
Orange refers specifically to "what our ancestors did," but it's more than that -- it's what was done to the ancestors. Everyone's memories shaped the present. We can't forget or ignore the atrocities and their impacts.


##### Conclusion
more powerful model? allows for choice? #review
