```ad-abstract
1.	**Prompt**: In his Prologue, Orange claims that “we are the memories we don’t remember, which live in us, which we feel” (10). Choose one character from the novel, and explain how he/she embodies, revises, or refutes this claim. Be sure to explain/define the quotation and how it connects to the character you are discussing.
```


### Idea

- rough: we are not the memories we don't remember, we live in the memories we don't remember 
	- seems pedantic, but this small nuance has much broader implications
		- you can reject reality
			- even if you don't know how it got there, you know what it is and can avoid it
		- you can change it (hope)
