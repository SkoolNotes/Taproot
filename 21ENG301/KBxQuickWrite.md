Is it about beacon of hope even in dark times? As in, there is always hope? Or is it darker, talking about how joyful activities are disconnected from the events of the real world? Singing as escapism, and joy as falsehood. Relates to There There... the meetup was was the celebration? Singing as community, or singing as communication, or singing as art? Hope never dies, or hope never matters? Or hope is crushed like in There There. Good example being Edwin if I remember correctly. 
Singing as joyful, and dark times as the opposite, emotions or states can exist in parallel? Talking about cultures existing in parallel despite not matching there surroundings? **ABOUT** the dark times -- is singing inherently joyful? Is joy or art itself corrupted by the darkness? Is singing the way to deal with the dark times? 
"Also" signing, so signing doesn't fit into the dark times. Thus, darkness can be contained? About dark times yet not dark times.
