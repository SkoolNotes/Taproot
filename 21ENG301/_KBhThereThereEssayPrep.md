    drink all the time.\" (99) AB

-   \"The night air was cool but didn\'t move\" (100) AD
-   \"She didn't know how to swim. Mostly she just wanted to be in the

    open her eyes, look at her hands, watch the bubbles rise in that
    bluest light.\" (100) AF
-   \"In this case Jaquie was the spider, and the minifridge was the

-   \"The trister spider, Veho, her mom used to used to tell her and
    Opah about, he was always stealing eyes to see better ... the white
    man who came and made the old world watch with his eyes ... Until
    your eyes are drained and you can\'t see behind you and there\'s
    nothnig ahead, and the needle, the bottle, or the pipe is the only
    thing in sight that makes any sense.\" (106) AK
-   \"She put a cough drop into her mouth so casually that you could
    tell she probably ate a lot of cough drops and smoked a lot of
    cigaretts, and never quite beat the caugh, but beat it enough while
    she was sucking on a cough drop, so ate them constantly\" (109) AM
-   \"There\'s an ache when you keep yourself from breathing. A relief
    when you come up for air. It was the same when you drank after
    telling yourself you wouldn\'t. Both broke at a point. Both gave and
    took.\" (116) AN

    done that? Instead she closes the curtains and turns on the

## Quote Development

### Quote sorting

1.  Eyes as bearers of memory

    -   AJ => dark memories as something her body (knee) forced into her
        mind (eyes)
    -   AK => the white men draining the eyes (memories?) of natives to
        include only drugs or alcahol

2.  Society\'s air creates pressures

    -   AF => unlike the atmosphere, water moves (bubles rise) but
        Jaquie can\'t swim
    -   AD => pain as a pressure manifest in the atmosphere holding
        Jaquie down
    -   AN => air as something addictive, that provides temporary relief
        that also takes something from you

3.  Society\'s drugs dulls pain

    -   AB => drinking as a form of slowing time
    -   AO => drinking as something dulling and \"solemn\"
    -   AR => systemic entertainment by the society (TV) favored by
        Jaquie over natural beauty

4.  Epic bottle of waste

    -   AM => Jaqueline\'s actions reveal about her smoking habits, and
        it manifests visually through cough
    -   AC => lack of static location of belonging and identity based on
        movement
    -   AA => the system rejects the pain that drive one to suicide
    -   AG => home is a trap, belonging is a trap
