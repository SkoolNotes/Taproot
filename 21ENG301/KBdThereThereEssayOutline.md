# Prompt

```
Orange theorizes the concept of the “Urban Indian” in his Prologue (11). Define this concept and explain how one of the novel’s characters navigates this modern identity alongside his/her ancestral roots.
```

# Outline

- Thesis (?)
	- **Tony's identity as an Urban Indian is initially characterized by his embracement of his urban upbringing and his Indian past, but as the novel progresses, Tony starts exploring the Indian cultural side of his identity.** (To be changed in the future)
- What is an Urban Indian?
	- "Urbanity" section in Prologue
	- Indians that were forced into an unfamiliar lifestyle and forced to lose their identity in favor of the status quo identity
	- Attached to their cultural past and their history
	- This is going to be a hard concept to communicate exactly into words in the essay
- Talk about Tony Loneman and the Drome
	- Face is a consequence of urban Indian life and its many hardships
		- Disconnect from culture and socioeconomic pressure leads many Urban Indians to alcohol addiction
	- Tony literally says that "the Drome" (i.e. Alcohol Poisoning) is "my mom and why she drank, it’s the way history lands on a face, and all the ways I made it so far despite how it has fucked with me since the day I found it there on the TV, staring back at me like a fucking villain."
		- In essence, the Drome is a metaphor (in Tony's, and in our, minds,) of the burden that is being an Urban Indian.
			- Drome causing Tony to be stupid => Stereotypes about Indians being stupid???
		- However, Tony claims that he has overcame the Drome
			- "all the ways I made it so far despite how it has fucked with me since the day I found it there on the TV"
- MF DOOM passage (May Remove)
	- "And it helped because the Drome’s what gives me my soul, and the Drome is a face worn through."
		- Tony has internalized the Drome as part of his identity (i.e. came to terms with it)
	- MF DOOM background
		- MF DOOM had many hardships (brother died, got dropped by his record label, was homeless for a while)
- Tony's disconnect from Indian culture
	- Evident in robbing the Powwow
		- Tony doesn't hesitate when Octavio tells him they will rob the Powwow
	- Tony still feels the Indian culture deep down
		- "I tightened my chin strap. I looked at my face. The Drome. I didn’t see it there. I saw an Indian. I saw a dancer."
			- To Tony (and other Urban Indians), embracing Indian culture (i.e. regalia) helps with overcoming the Drome (i.e. Urban Indian burden).
		- Tony's actions in last chapter
			- ""

# Essay

Tony is initially apathetic towards Indian culture in favor of the urban culture he grew up in, and only interacts with his Indian heritage through contemplating on the troubled past of his people.
