            <p>Not we are the memories we don’t remember, but we live in the memories we don’t remember. Ancestors -&gt; ancestor experiences -&gt; ancestor actions -&gt; shape world -&gt; shape us ancestor experiences &amp; actions = memories we don’t remember in my model While it sounds pedantic, it has much broader implications.</p>
            <h5 id="denial">Denial</h5>
            <p>One cannot know what part of them stems from the memories we don’t remember. Orange talks about these parts being the culture, but that can be rejected. One can’t deny the memories because they are intangible, but one can deny reality. Updated model allows for choice.</p>
            <h5 id="hope">Hope</h5>
            <p>One can’t change what happened in the past. But, one can change the world, can change where they live. We are not <em>just</em> the memories we don’t remember. We are also the memories we do remember!</p>
            <h5 id="breadth">Breadth</h5>
            <p>Orange refers specifically to “what our ancestors did,” but it’s more than that – it’s what was done to the ancestors. Everyone’s memories shaped the present. We can’t forget or ignore the atrocities and their impacts.</p>
