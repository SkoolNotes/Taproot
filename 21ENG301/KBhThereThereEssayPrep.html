            <p><strong>In Tommy Orange’s novel <em>There There</em>, the author’s use of third-person narration of Jacquie’s character externalizes the systems in society which strip her of individual identity, group belonging, and accusatory capacity though the disenfranchisement of independent action, antagonizing of attached heritage, and suppression of analytical freedom respectively: creating a multifaceted grappling of the historical forces of oppression that plagues upon Native Americans in modern society.</strong></p>
