# Notes

## Prologue
- Usually conquest of America is viewed from a Western (Eurocentric) perspective, but we should look at it also from a **Native American perspective**
- This isn't easy because Native Americans didn't really write stuff down
- Text will look at how we might actually do this

## Ch 2
- European settlement didn't seem so significant in the 16th and early 17th century
	- Rivalries between tribes, etc. seemed more important
- Consequences of European settlement
	- Environmental changes that were bad for Indians
	- Cultural changes
	- Spreading of microbes

### Pattern of settlements
- Spanish settlement in southeast (e.g. Florida)
- Basque, French, English fishing from Newfoundland to Cape Cod
	- Some made semi-permanent camps which acted as trading camps
- English in Chesapeake Bay, settled Jamestown 1607
- French build Quebec in Stadacona 1608
- Henry Hudson explores Hudson river 1609
- Large European companies start settling in areas

### European settlements lead to importing of European objects
- **Trading system created**
- Some European manufacturers made items for Indians or took Indian items and made them into European objects
- Raw materials were important; metal items were valued by what they were made from rather than function
- Indians only started using European goods as they were intended after large colonies were settled
- European goods were valuable to Indians as well as European settlers and improved quality of life
- Some Indian culture shaped itself around European objects / absorbed European culture
- Weapons were much better
	- Ofc guns were cool
	- Metal blades had much greater impact initially
	- Arms race among Indian tribes
		- Stabilized after enough European colony settlements (200 years)
	- Guns sought after after arms race stabilization
		- Policies in place to prevent trade to Indians, but trade happened anyways because of economic incentive
- Beaver hunting and traps
	- Beaver pelts were very, **very** important
	- Beaver hunting reshaped political power
		- Intertribal and intratribal politics shifted from beaver pelts
### Environmental changes
- Demand for beavers led to overhunting led to regional extinctions
	- Didn't impact beaver populations in the long term
	- Impacted environment significantly
- Use of land differed between Indians and European settlers
	- Land as "resource" (Indian) vs "commodity" (European)
	- Indian farming productivity was significant
		- Diversity in plants (corn, beans, squash, etc)
	- North America lacked farmable animals
	- Deforestation and pasture creation for domesticated farm animals by Europeans
		- Restricted Native American lifestyles
		- Pigs, Chickens, etc. stole resources away from wild animals
### Disease introduction
- Crap ton of impact in the form of deaths, even in early days of settlement
- Problem worsened from family migrations to North America
- Disease decreased labor output by Natives
	- Created many socioeconomic problems

## Conclusion
**Native Americans were dynamic and adapted to changing environment**
