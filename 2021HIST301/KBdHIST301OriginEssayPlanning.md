# Prompt
```
The telling of American history has become one of the focal points of conflicts over our national culture,
particularly the relationship between ideas of American exceptionalism and stories of race and conquest in 
US history. What is the value of a shared national narrative and what dangers does crafting such a narrative 
present? Why does the telling of US history generate such controversy?

In a 2-3 page, double spaced essay, evaluate how the authors we’ve read so far approach the telling of 
American history and make an argument for what you see as the key considerations in constructing a narrative
of early American history. Historical narratives, by their nature, are created through choices of what to 
include and what not, what to emphasize and what to relegate to the margins. In making your argument, include 
an explicit engagement with the sources we’ve worked with so far. You might, for example, engage with the 
controversy over the 1619 project, with Dunbar-Ortiz’s criticism of multiculturalism or with Richter’s 
geographical positioning of history.

# Outline

### Main idea
There isn't a clear consensus as to what topics to discuss among scholars in regards to early American history (before 1776). Some scholars write mainly about the economic aspect of pre-independence history, whereas others may write mainly about the culture of the many groups that inhabited early North America. However, the two topics are not mutually exclusive, and in fact are causal: economics influence culture, and culture influences economics.

### Progression
1. Intro thing - present thesis
2. Delve into intersection of culture and economics
	1. Example 1
	2. Example 2
	3. etc.
3. Conclusion: Why is this analysis style important?
	1. More specifically, how does the "new view" of culture and economics being merged impact American history as a subject and how does that have an impact on current day politics/social dynamics/etc.?
