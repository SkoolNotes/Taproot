# Prompt
```
The telling of American history has become one of the focal points of conflicts over our national culture,
particularly the relationship between ideas of American exceptionalism and stories of race and conquest in 
US history. What is the value of a shared national narrative and what dangers does crafting such a narrative 
present? Why does the telling of US history generate such controversy?

In a 2-3 page, double spaced essay, evaluate how the authors we’ve read so far approach the telling of 
American history and make an argument for what you see as the key considerations in constructing a narrative
of early American history. Historical narratives, by their nature, are created through choices of what to 
include and what not, what to emphasize and what to relegate to the margins. In making your argument, include 
an explicit engagement with the sources we’ve worked with so far. You might, for example, engage with the 
controversy over the 1619 project, with Dunbar-Ortiz’s criticism of multiculturalism or with Richter’s 
geographical positioning of history.
