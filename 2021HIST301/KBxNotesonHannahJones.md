```ad-question
1. What would you descirbe as Hannah-Jones's goal in her introduction?
2. Is Hannah-Jones creating the progessive narrative that Cowie is calling for or is the 1619 prioject an example of anti-patriotism on the left?
```

1. make herself infallable?
2. anti-patriotism. no options to solve
	1. nvm, she acknolgeses that things get better, therfore america is not doomed.

cowies anti-patriotism: america is bad, and we can't solve it.
fundemental: views it as solvable or unsolvable
redeemable vs. solvable
past vs future


```ad-def
Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.

- to be authentic responsible scholars: start with the text, then go into criticisms.
	- can't critique until you understand her ideas

- thesis: black americans fought for freedom and paved the way for others freedom

mythology vs story -- used by tom

- civil rights act: 
	- patriotism by descent
- special place for descent in our culture
	- celebrating tradition of descent
	
- the facts are not the intresting controvery

- CRT emerged in the 80-90s
	- started in legal studies, moved into public policy
- deals with: why do we have sytemic racism if we dont mention race in our legal system?
- argues, we need more than race neutral conversation / terminology
	- racists shaped more than the slavery itself?
