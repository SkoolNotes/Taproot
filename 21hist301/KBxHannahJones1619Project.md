# Hannah Jones 1619
```ad-abstract
Our Democracy's Founding Ideals were False when they were written. Black Americans have fought to make them true.
```


- always has pristine american flag even though everything else is crumbling
	- dad grew up as a slave
	- family tried to leave and failed

- dad joined the army to serve the country, so the contry would treat him as american
- didnt understand patriotism because america treated black people so poorly
	- was embarrased by the flag outside

- slaves contributed greatly to the succes and creation of america?
- one fith of the country!

- argues that black people are the exemplars and the progressers of our democracy
- argues that black people have fought in many wars
	- are the most likely of all racial groups to serve in the us military
- says that the nations true founding fathers are the slaves!

- says that the brutal system of slavery was unlike anything that had existed before
	- is that true??
- democratic ideals, according to the author:
	- higher min wage,
	- ubi
- black americans suffer most from violent crime
	- 13% population, 36% of non-fatal violent crime?
- talks about apropiation?

```ad-reflection
about how black people created the country, and fought for freedom and are thus the most american? 
does what your ancenstors did effect how american you are? if born black post slavery, does you still get the amerizanizing fought slavery credit? 
should we really distinguish who is american by race?

races are equal, not better.

ig claims that being american is fighting for freedom and believing in the ideals?
