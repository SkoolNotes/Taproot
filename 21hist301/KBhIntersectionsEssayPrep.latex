  "Words like 'invasion' and 'conquest' may now trip more easily from
  our tongues than quaint phrases like "the transit of civilization,
  'yet the ``master narrative'' of early America remains essentially
  European-focused." (Richter 8) AA =\textgreater{} AA narrative
  regarding early European American is vastly softened but nevertheless
  Eurocentric
\item
  "The paucity of historical sources and the enormous distances in time
  and culture that yawn between the twenty-first and seventeenth
  centuries make it impossible to see the world through her eyes."
  (Richter 9) AB =\textgreater{} AB Richter claims impossiblity of
  recovering an Americacentric narrative b/c cannot see through "their"
  (NM's) eyes
\item
  "At this point in our fractious nation's experience, it seems more
  than necessary and desirable to find frames of reference capable of
  embracing the common, if often excruciating, origins of the
  continent's diverse peoples." (Richter 10) AC =\textgreater{} AC
  claims that it is necessary to create a common narrative that blends
  the diversity into one
\item
  "Only after the establishment of large-scale European colonies---and
  the much bigger and more predictable patterns of trade they allowed
  did Indians begin to use imported goods in ways that resembled the
  purposes for which they had been designed." (Richter 43) AD
  =\textgreater{} AD \textbf{only} after the establishment of European
  trading could the Indians
\item
  "The news things were \textbf{\textbf{always}} in some practical way
  superior to the old --- lighter, sharper, more durable --- but they
  were used in very familiar contexts." (Richter 44) AE =\textgreater{}
  AE Richter claims that European technology was better and was a
  drop-in replacement for NM tech
\item
  "Something as basic as firemaking was radically simplified not just by
  axes that made firewood more readily obtainable but by flint and still
  'strike-a-lights'" (Richter 44) AF =\textgreater{} AF claims that
  European technology "does it better in a variety of situations"
\item
  "The vastly increased supply did not so much devalue what was once
  rare as create an innovative cultural phenomenon rooted in
  unprecedented abundance" (Richter 46) AJ =\textgreater{} AJ European
  economic disruption created abundance and created a "cultural
  phenomenon"
\item
  "But all of this Indian abundance depended on a kind of mobility and
  flexible use of the landscape that would prove incompatible with the
  colonists' ways of interacting with the environment." (Richter 57) AH
  =\textgreater{} AH NM technology was incompatible with European ways
\item
  "With literally everyone sick, and the able-bodied adults more
  incapacitated than the rest, the everyday work of raising crops,
  gathering wild plants, fetching water and firewood, hunting meat, and
  harvesting fish virtually ceased." (Richter 61) AI =\textgreater{} AI
  sickness incapacitated the abled-bodied and cripped normal activities
\item
  "Nice distinctions between restoration for victims and bloodthirsty
  revenge must frequendy have blurred." (Richter 66) AJ =\textgreater{}
  AJ simply replenishing of war captives often blurred with revenge
\item
  "In all of this, eastern Native people were anything but passive
  victims unable to change." (Richter 66) AK =\textgreater{} AK Native
  people are not just passive victims but
\item
  "The mourning-war pattern seems unquestionably old in eastern North
  Amer- ica, but it assumed explosive new forms and vastly expanded
  scope under the demographic pressures of the seventeenth century."
  (Richter 66) AL =\textgreater{} AL
\item
  "As Nathan Huggins once said ofAfrican American history, 'it is
  exactly this triumph of the human spirit over adversity that is the
  great story.' The same is true for Native American history from the
  early seventeenth century onward." (Richter 68) AM =\textgreater{} AM
\item
  "There were elaborate markets in each city and a far-flung trade
  network that used routes established by the Toltecs." (Dunbar-Ortiz 7)
  BA =\textgreater{} BA
\item
  "Native peoples were colonized and deposed of their territories as
  distinct peoples--- hundreds of nations---not as a racial or ethnic
  group." (Dunbar-Ortiz 2) BB =\textgreater{} BB
\item
  "Indigenous survival as peoples is due to centuries of resistance and
  storytelling passed through the generations, and I sought to
  demonstrate that this survival is dynamic, not passive." (Dunbar-Ortiz
  2) BC =\textgreater{} BC
\item
  "Being pressed for tribute through violent attacks, peasants rebelled
  and there were uprisings all over Mexico. Cortes's recruitment of
  resistant communities all over Mexico as allies aided in toppling the
  central regime." (Dunbar-Ortiz 7) BD =\textgreater{} BD
\item
  "Averaging thirty feet wide, these roads followed straight courses,
  even through difficult terrain such as hills and rock formations. The
  highways connected some seventy-five communities." (Dunbar-Ortiz 8) BE
  =\textgreater{} BE

  "Cahokia supported a population oftens of thousands, larger than that
  of London during the same period." (Dunbar-Ortiz 9) BF =\textgreater{}
  BF
\item
  "the practice of herbal medicine and even sur- gery and dentistry, and
  most importantly both hygienic and ritual bathing, kept diseases at
  bay" (Dunbar-Ortiz 9) BG =\textgreater{} BG
\item
  "According to the value system that drove consensus building and
  decision making in these societies, the community's interest over-
  rode individual interests." (Dunbar-Ortiz 10) BH =\textgreater{} BH
\item
  "Algonquians eventually accepted Jesuit celibacy, but the Jesuits
  never accepted Algonquian sexual mores, particularly when other
  Frenchmen proved so enthusiastic about them." (White 60) CA
  =\textgreater{} CA
\item
  "Sex was hardly a personal affair; it was governed and regulated by
  the appropriate authorities." (White 60) CB =\textgreater{} CB
\item
  "To understand sexual relations between Algonquians and Europeans, we
  must remove the combination of sexual fantasy, social criticism, and
  Jansenism with which the French often veiled their descriptions."
  (White 61) CC =\textgreater{} CC
\item
  "She could leave her husband and return to her own family whenever she
  chose. Among many groups adultery was not harshly punished" (White 62)
  CD =\textgreater{} CD

  "European conceptions of marriage, adultery, and prostitution just
  could not encompass the actual variety of sexual relations in the pays
  d'en haut." (White 63) E =\textgreater{} E
\item
  "Prostitution had little to do with that term as commonly understood
  \ldots{} Sex accompanied a general agreement to do the work commonly
  expected of women in Algonquian society" (White 65) CF =\textgreater{}
  CF
\item
  "This stress on a powerful female religious figure, whose power, like
  that of the Jesuits, was connected with sexualabstinence, attracted a
  congregation composed largely of women" (White 67) CG =\textgreater{}
  CG
\item
  "Jesuit influence threatened not only sexual activity but also the
  ability of traders and coureurs de bois to create the ties to
  Algonquian society on which their trade, and perhaps their lives,
  depended." (White 68) CH =\textgreater{} CH
\item
  "Jesuits and higher French officials, however, were unenthusiastic
  about marriage both because it gave voyageurs and \emph{coureurs de
  bois} an independent hold in the pays d'en haut and also for racist
  reasons." (White 69) CI =\textgreater{} CI
