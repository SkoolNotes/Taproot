# Talking about the Essay

See [Intersection Essay Prep](KBhIntersectionsEssayPrep.org).

## File Organization

-   Take a look at \"Colonial America, notes\", which are the notes of
    the class
-   A PDF of the slides are also available

## When is the draft due?

IDK. He still won\'t tell. :(

# European Colonization

A \"world-wide imperial contest\", a global political competition. Not
primarily motivated by spreading *democracy*, its about Monies.

-   Spanish: started the conquest, for the Spanish armada
-   English: bubbling, for minor economic modivation
-   French: interested in fur, and trying to maximize gain and
    investment

So, compare and contrast the three systems.

# Voyages of Discovery

## Motivations

-   Rise of a *business* oriented class
-   Pooling of resources for investment
-   Tech: astrolabe, maps, compass, better ships, etc.

## Mercantilism

A pair-relationship between colonies:

-   Mother Country provides...
    -   Finished products
    -   Protection
    -   Governance
-   Colonies provides...
    -   Raw materials
    -   Monopolies on market
    -   Loyalty

# Colonizers

## Russians!

Russia traveling from west => east; competing with the northern going
group.

## Spain!

\"Superpower\" built upon the Spanish Navy (the \"armada.\")

-   Mission: churches religions and cultures (supposed to be
    self-sufficient)
-   Presidio: military gates and posts
-   Pueblos: living

### Goals

-   Find Gold!
-   Acquire Land!
-   Develop Trade!
-   Christian conversion (mostly to get papal decree

### Weaknesses

-   Spanish empire stretched pretty thin
-   Did not allow others to come trade, which means limited

# Colonized

-   No respect for Native American cultures or strategies of land use
-   Every mission courtyard had a place where those who disobeyed where
    wipped
-   Father Junipero Serra: think that the native were \"childlike\" and
    required education
