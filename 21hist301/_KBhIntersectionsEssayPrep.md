-   \"Words like \'invasion\' and \'conquest\' may now trip more easily
    fromourtongues thanquaintphrases like \"the transit of civilization,
    \'yet the "master narrative" of early America remains essentially
    European- focused.\" (Richter 8)
-   \"The paucity ofhistoricalsources and the enormous distances in time
    and culture that yawn between the twenty-first and seventeenth
    centuries make it impossible to see the world through her eyes. \"
    (Richter 9)
-   \"At this point in our fractious nation's experience, it seems more
    than necessary and desirable to find frames of reference capable of
    embracing the common, if often excruciating, origins of the
    continent\'s diverse peoples.\" (Richter 10)
-   \"Only after the establishment of large-scale European
    colonies---and the much bigger and more predictable patterns of
    trade they allowed--- did Indians begin to use imported goods in
    ways that resembled the pur- poses for which they had been
    designed.\" (Richter 43)
-   \"The news things were ****always**** in some practical way superior
    to the old --- lighter, sharper, more durable --- but they were used
    in very familiar contexts.\" (Richter 44)
-   \"Something as basic as firemaking was radically simplified not just
    by axes that made firewood more readily obtainable but by flint and
    still \'strike-a-lights\'\" (Richter 44)
-   \"The vastly increased supply did not so much devalue what was once
    rare as create an innovative cultural phenomenon rooted in
    unprecedented abundance\" (Richter 46)
-   \"But all of this Indian abundance depended on a kind of mobility
    and flexible use ofthe landscape thatwould prove incompatible with
    the colo- nists' ways ofinteracting with the environment.\"
    (Richter 57)
-   \"With literally everyone sick, and the able-bodied adults more
    incapacitated than the rest, the everyday work of raising crops,
    gathering wild plants, fetching water and firewood, hunting meat,
    and harvesting fish virtually ceased.\" (Richter 61)
-   \"Nice distinctions between restoration for victims and bloodthirsty
    revenge must frequendy have blurred.\" (Richter 66)
-   \"In all of this, eastern Native people were anything but passive
    victims unable to change.\" (Richter 66)
-   \"The mourning-war pattern seems unquestionably old in eastern North
    Amer- ica, but it assumed explosive new forms and vastly expanded
    scope under the demographic pressures of the seventeenth century.\"
    (Richter 66)
-   \"As Nathan Huggins once said ofAfrican American history, \'it is
    exactly this triumph of the human spirit over adversity that is the
    great story.\' The same is true for Native American history from the
    early seventeenth century onward.\" (Richter 68)
-   \"There were elaborate markets in each city and a far-flung trade
    network that used routes established by the Toltecs.\"

-   \"Native peoples were colonized and deposed of their territories as
    distinct peoples--- hundreds of nations---not as a racial or ethnic
    group.\" (Dunbar-Ortiz 2)
-   \"Indigenous survival as peoples is due to centuries of resistance
    and storytelling passed through the generations, and I sought to
    demonstrate that this survival is dynamic, not passive.\"
    (Dunbar-Ortiz 2)
-   \"Being pressed for tribute through violent attacks, peasants
    rebelled and there were uprisings all over Mexico. Cortes's
    recruitment of resistant communities all over Mexico as allies aided
    in toppling the central regime.\" (Dunbar-Ortiz 7)
-   \"Averaging thirty feet wide, these roads followed straight courses,
    even through difficult terrain such as hills and rock formations.

    that of London during the same period.\" (Dunbar-Ortiz 9)
-   \"the practice of herbal medicine and even sur- gery and dentistry,
    and most importantly both hygienic and ritual bathing, kept diseases
    at bay\" (Dunbar-Ortiz 9)

    rode individual interests.\" (Dunbar-Ortiz 10)
