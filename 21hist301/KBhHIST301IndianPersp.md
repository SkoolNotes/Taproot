## Expertise
Born half native-american, but not raised with Native American culture. Argues that the Native Amercian technologies were really davanced, and they had advanced techonolgy and trade.

Evidence of plating and trade was advanced; used the example of corn shows the innovative and advanced means by which it is planted.
