# And the great experiment begins..

- tracing liberty, democracy and ext chellenged by tracing opression, exploitation, and racism
	- which is good, cus it makes us examine the role of slavery more directly?
- argues, slavery is more than an exception
- cant dismiss liberty and equality either!
- both developments, liberty & equality and slavery were going on at the same time
- **this was the paradox**
	- how could this happen? big question for colonial historian
	
```ad-qoute
free ships make free goods
```

- cardinal doctrine
	- goods were produced by slave labor
	
```ad-important
"americans bought their indepenndence with slave labor"
```

- racism, liberty only applies to light skinned people, but doesn't fully account for the paradox? 
- "the man who depended on another for his living could never be truly free"
- jefferson
	- hated debt
		- becuase it limiteed his freedom of action
		- he could not free his slaves as long as he was in debt
```ad-comment
his animosity towards hamilton was because of hamiltons pro-British foreign policy, which would tighten the hold of british creditors 
and his domestic policy, which would place the government in the debt of native american creditors 
```
- jeffery, jeffery ison
	- almost obsessive about debt
	- country of debtors was ripe for tyranny
	- the citizens of a republic must be free from the control of other men and that they could be free only if they were econollically free 
		- by virtue of owning land on which to support themselves
	- didn't like artificers!
- people belived that people in the dregs of society arrived at that position through their own vice and misconduct
- andrew fletcher
	- big libery guy, also big slave guy
	- didnt like the church for setting up hospitals cus it permitted the non working man to live
	- all the non-working men were proposed to be maid into to slaves to men of property 
	- argues that it is in the masters best intrest to treat slaves well, unless slaves are behaving poorly
		- jesus...
		
```ad-qoute
but [jefferson] did share fletcher's distrust of men who were free in the name while their empty bellies made them thieves
```
- made them slaves to anybody who would feem them?
- jefferson did not want the "idle poor" to be reduced to slavery
- problem: freeing slaves -> half a mil "idle poor"
	- the idea: slaves were acustomed to compulsory labor and would not work withough it
- jefferson wanted to teach his slaves as part of his plan for freeing them

- cimarrons and stuff, 
	- they didn't like the spanish, teamed with peopled
	- robbed em
	
-  virginia made englishmen out of all kinds of people?
	-  natives had all the rights of others
		-  slave or not?
- virginia actully killed alot of the people when went there
	- via disease
- market was not going well
- virginia kept inheriting immigrants
- described as "a sinke to drayen England of her filth and scum"
- rebelion happened!
- virginia inhereted englands social problem
	- solution: restrict liberties of those who did not have the proper badge of freedom
- then, laws set in place to allow people to keep their servants for as long as possible
- 1670, voting was limited to landholers and housholders
- solution put an end to the process of turning natives into englishmen?
	- the rights of the enlglismen were preserved buy destroing the rights of the africans
	
- slavery "came" to virginia unthinkingly
	- people just bought the cheapest option
	- laws were passed to discriminate
	- 

- argues that all the good came out of slavery

```ad-qoute
thus began the american paradox of slavery and freedon, intertwined and interdependent, right rights of englishmen supported on the wrongs of Africans. 
```
