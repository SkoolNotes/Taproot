### skimming strat!
everyrone should have one
isnt expecting to read every page, epsec in college
experiment with skimming
no need to mem every page
etc.

tom does rec and outlines sections / types of argument

```ad-idea
try automating?
```


### questions

```ad-question
1.  What is “The Myth” of US history that Dunbar-Ortiz seeks to challenge?
    
2.  Why does the history of indigenous peoples not fit into the framework of multiculturalism?
    
3.  How does Dunbar-Ortiz’s approach to the history of the United States compare with Hannah-Jones?
    
4.  What is the difference between an “origin narrative” and a history of the founding of the United States? What role does each play in our understanding of the country?
```


3. hannah-jones still has american exceptionalism, dunbar says it's all bad?
	1. multiculturalism -> mixed salad, distinct
		1. dunbar argues that natives got assimilated
		2. hannah jones argues that natives drove that which makes america exceptional

```ad-tip
every author has a "project," an agenda
```


the history of american bends towrds freedom - ~obama
no, it's cus of brutal fighting, argues dunbar and friends

```ad-qoute
we've kind of been looking at things from the perspective of the left a little bit
```
"america, love it or leave it"

			- not about racial harmony
