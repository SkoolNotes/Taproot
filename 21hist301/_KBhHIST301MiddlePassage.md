# Discussion of the Middle Passage Reading

****Manifest destiny****: European-American team for subjugation

## Discussion of Viewpoints

### Afrocentric View

-   That there is a core, \"pure\" African view
-   Middle passage did not change the African culture
-   Cites cultural example in Haiti, etc. as the mark of cultural
    survival

### Traditionalist View

-   That there was no continuance from African culture after the middle
    passage
-   Essentially, a new generation was born, and the culture did not
    survive the middle passage at all.

### Cultural Syncretism

-   Combination of the two?
-   That the middle passage was a change and process of combination
-   That African culture from different places was brought to the
    America to form a new element. A process of translation and a
    modification
-   Creation of the \"New World\" multicultural system

## Defining Slavery

\"Kidnapping.\" Weaponized processes of African communities, pitched
cultures against each other. Europeans turned people against each other.

\*\*\"Divide & Conquer\"\*\*: British Colonial policy --- created
conflicts and leveraged people against each other.

## Defining Culture

There is no Monolithic African culture. In fact, most of the African
captives were shipped to the Caribbeans and South America.

## Is literature a good history?

Variety of perspectives in as derived for literature. The leverage of
religion as the \"Great Awakening\".

The idea of \"Black Churches\" as a point of strength in the American
south.

## Initialization

-   Not initially *racial* slavery; it was simply those who are enslaved
    are enslaved
-   Due to labor shortage indentured servants were no longer viable
    -   Due to shortage, had to turn to Africa
    -   Also allowing

## Downfall

-   Peak to downfall of slavery as an accepting institution
-   Created coverage of the American revolution
-   From Revolution Brits offer emaciation for Black Solders
-   Large controversy: American demand of freedom to England is similar
    to that of Africans
    -   Huge use of vocabulary --- \"enslaved\" by the policy
    -   \"all men were created equal\", so what about..
-   Constitutional Convention\'s 3/5 compromise
    -   Justification of \"All men equal\"
    -   Slavery though, still a sign of wealth

## Discussion

Slavery also lead many into debt. British Bankers held debt, so
revolution essentially allowed the institution of slavery to continue by
absolving the debt of debters.
