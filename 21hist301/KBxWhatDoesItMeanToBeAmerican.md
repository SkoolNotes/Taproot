# so, what does it mean?

*freewrite:*

---

america -> really just a place
more connected to silicon valley

don't understand what "not america" is 

i did not choose to live in america, thus im not proud of it

america as a set of idealogies

being american = believing the idealogies? or the specific social contract

silicon valley -> fluidity of ideas and innovation, and the resources and hope to do it?

built on distrust of authority
heredity  authroity soecifically 

stuck in the same place is not american
	via capitalism and poverty cycles

american dream is everyone has the ability to climb via capitalslm

### the american dream

```ad-def
anyone, regardless of where they were born or what class they were born into, can attain their own version of success in a society in which upward mobility is possible for everyone.
```

- nuclear family and heavy community? but also capitalism?
- expressing oneself is american

```ad-question
is republicanism more intertwined with the founding energy of the country?
```
classical, most likely.

> can do spirit - *lauren*

- american exceptionalism
	- we are the best, but also uniqe in history 
	- outside of the historyicl trajectory
	- allowed because of lack of fedaulism

```ad-question
what is best?
```

- america in the world



### patriotism

trumpian

```ad-def
One of the core lessons of Trumpian politics is that Americans are starved for a meaningful politics of what it means to be American. Getting rid of the vainglorious Trump administration is only a partial solution. The causes of his rise remain.
```

```ad-qoute
the left says that america is just crap
```

he says that the left says that america is iredeamable

why reclaim?

it has been effective






```ad-important
```ad-question
How might we articulate a sense of nationalism that mitigates the lure of exclusion and ethno-cultural definitions of citizenship? Come up with a pitch for how the idea of America might be used to advance such a vision of nationalism. You can choose to ground this notion of nationalism within a set of leftist policies, conservative policies, and/or be ideologically agnostic.
