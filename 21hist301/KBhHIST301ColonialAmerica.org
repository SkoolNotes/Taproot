See [[file:KBhIntersectionsEssayPrep.org][Intersection Essay Prep]].

** File Organization
- Take a look at "Colonial America, notes", which are the notes of the class
- A PDF of the slides are also available

** When is the draft due?
IDK. He still won't tell. :(

* European Colonization
A "world-wide imperial contest", a global political competition. Not primarily motivated by spreading /democracy/, its about Monies.

- Spanish: started the conquest, for the Spanish armada
- English: bubbling, for minor economic modivation
- French: interested in fur, and trying to maximize gain and investment

So, compare and contrast the three systems.

* Voyages of Discovery

** Motivations
- Rise of a /business/ oriented class
- Pooling of resources for investment
- Tech: astrolabe, maps, compass, better ships, etc.

** Mercantilism
A pair-relationship between colonies:

- Mother Country provides...
  - Finished products
  - Protection
  - Governance
- Colonies provides... 
  - Raw materials

* Colonizers

** Russians!
Russia traveling from west => east; competing with the northern going group.

** Spain!
"Superpower" built upon the Spanish Navy (the "armada.")

- Mission: churches religions and cultures (supposed to be self-sufficient)
- Presidio: military gates and posts
- Pueblos: living

*** Goals
- Find Gold!
- Acquire Land!
- Develop Trade!
- Christian conversion (mostly to get papal decree

*** Weaknesses
- Spanish empire stretched pretty thin
- Did not allow others to come trade, which means limited

* Colonized
- No respect for Native American cultures or strategies of land use
- Every mission courtyard had a place where those who disobeyed where wipped
- Father Junipero Serra: think that the native were "childlike" and required education
