# Russian Revolution
Europe Happened. There is competition and still the urge of European hegemony that is present in Europe, and from that urge there stemmed the need for central leadership in each country. Of course, communistic states can't really have a strong central leadership, so Lenin justified it basically by saying that "the populous are dumb". Establishing this expectiation simply makes the state more willing to excercise their sense of superiority.

One may argue that Lenin never wanted actual marxist control â€” he simply was a dictatorship.
