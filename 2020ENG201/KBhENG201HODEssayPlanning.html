            <p><strong>Through tracking the motif of Kurtz’s — and, to a lesser extent, Marlow’s — interaction with enchantment and its subsequent effect to the characters in the <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, the novel reveals that the powerful and “delightful” charm of Africa could be mispurposed by foreigners to bring crippling effects upon themselves.</strong></p>
            <p>This may end up sounding racist — Conrad warns of the potentially crippling and reciprocal effect of the misguided exploitation of the “charm” that exists within the African lands by Europeans. (Could accidentally justify Conrad.)</p>
            <p>CITE in intro/conclusion of Achebe’s analysis…</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Africa has inherent, not necessarily negative charm</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>EA: it attracted Marlow there</p></li>
            <li><p>EB: Marlow does not understand the spellbound natives’ own ways</p></li>
            <li><p>EC: getting to Kurtz was pictured as a fairytale, less as a very sinister act</p></li>

            <li><p>EF: The naïve Kurtz uses his charm to charm others to charm</p></li>
