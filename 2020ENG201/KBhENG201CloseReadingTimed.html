            <h2 id="prompt">Prompt</h2>
            <p>Select one of the following citations from Roy’s <em>The God of Small Things</em> for your in-class close reading writing. Be sure to examine the specific denotation and connotations of Roy’s language.</p>
            <pre><code>Chacko said:
            -   You don’t _go_ to Oxford. You _read_ at Oxford.
            And
            -   After _reading_ at Oxford, you _come down._

            “Down to earth, d’you mean?” Ammu would ask. “_That_ you definitely do. 
            Like your famous airplanes.”

            Ammu said that the sad but entirely predictable fate of Chacko’s airplanes 
            was an impartial measure of his abilities. (55)</code></pre>
            <p>Reading, the double entendre. “Study (an academic subject) at a university.” (OED, AA) However, in this passage, there’s also “understand or interpret the nature or significance of.” (OED, AB).</p>
            <p>Come down — a sense of superority — a sense of criticism w.r.t. Chacko has a sense of superority. Chaco’s aeromodeling kit kept crashing, shows dichotomy between reality and fiction.</p>
            <p>Chacko’s airplones, kits — arranged — that he always messes up. Similar to his running of the factory. Prearranged systems that he messes up.</p>
            <p>Effect of sarcasm: famous. <em>Is famous sacrasm??</em></p>
            <p>The sense of British superority used against him. Infatuation with titles.</p>
            <ol>
            <li><p>Infatuation with titles and male chavinism</p></li>
            </ol>
            <p>You don’t go to oxford, you “understand” at oxford. And after you understand at oxford, you rid yourself of your corrupt ways. One does not simply head to oxford, one attempts to see and understand (Luke 19:5), and Come Down to rid of sins.</p>
            <p>Inherent sense of superority, for Chacko, Oxford is the tree that allows him to see Jesus. Marxist.</p>
            <p>Ammu instead offers an alternate interpretation, instead of meeting a Jesus like figure, one actually meets a harsher figure: the ground. One acutally comes down to earth, and, instead of seeing Jesus and achiving salvation, chacko bites the dirt…. by destroying prebuilt systems.</p>
            <p>Unexpected use of famous — well known, but not because they were good but instead because of they were expressly terriable — offers sharp dichotomy like that offered by Ammu before.</p>
            <p>Highlights the contrasting nature of the sibling dynamic.</p>
            <p>Sad — a powerless word — highlights Ammu’s lack of control over Chacko’s falling plane. Because male superority. Because she does not have control, she could only observe and pity.</p>
            <h2 id="claim">Claim</h2>
            <p>So three things</p>
            <ol>
            <li><p>Chacko derives a sense of superiority at Oxford — believing that it grants him access to a hightened understading and be “saved”</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>He does not simply read at harvard, he “reads” — attempting to “understand/interpreate the nature” of things at Oxford.</p></li>
            <li><p>Then, after he “understands”, he “comes down”. This is reminiscent as KJV Luke 19:4-5, when the greedy tax collector Zacchaeus of Jericho climbed up a tree to see Jesus — “to understand … the nature”, and then got asked to “come down” b/c Jesus wants to go to his house.</p></li>
            <li><p>Chacko expected that Oxford the tree allowed him to “come down” and be “saved” perhaps from his current station (future land lord, not unlike Zaccheaus). However, his sister offers a different interpretation:</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>Instead, his sister contradicts him, stating that he instead comes “down to earth” and, instead of being saved by his Oxford education, simply bites the dirt</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>His family’s pickle factory became unprofitable after Chacko took over — just like his fallen airplanes, which are boxed sets already setup for him only for him to incorrectly assemble and crash due to the discord that exists between his supposed newfound hightened understanding and his actual management abilitiy.</p></li>
            <li><p>Ammu remarks that the airplanes are “famous” — really infamous. Although not a strict verbal irony, Ammu uses the the term because it is opposite the tipical connotation. Chacko’s airplanes are famous not for a positive quality but instead for its ease of failure. Elongating the previous metaphore, this forshadows a potential, infamous failure for Paradise pickles</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>Remarking upon all of this, Ammu is “sad”</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Sadness is quite a passive emotion — she is unappy, and regretful, but due to the “male chavunist nature” of society he is unable to act</p></li>
            <li><p>Ammu slightly laments her station in life this way, hinting that she could actually see the problem clearer than Chacko as his failure is “predictable”</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>In the passage selected in the GOST, Roy leverages biblical illusions, creative word choices, and entended metaphores to highlight Ammu’s conflict with the ‘male chauvinist’ superiority exhibited by Chaco and leverages this conflict to forshadow the eventual downfall of their family business.</strong></p>
