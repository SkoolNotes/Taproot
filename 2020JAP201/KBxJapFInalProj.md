	-   many types of hot springs
	-   amazing park
	-   the "Hells of Beppu"
	-   monkey park
    
-   What you can see, do, and/or eat there
	-   onsen food
		-   onsen egg
	-   hot springs, of course, but also hot sand baths and steam baths
    
-   Why you like it or recommend it
	-   hot springs are very cool
	-   food is very good
