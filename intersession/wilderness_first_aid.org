#+TITLE: Flo--wilderness first aid
* diff between normal first aid and wilderness first aid
** when you are 2 hours away from a hospital
*** either far or will tike a while to get there
* requires
** improv
** thinking on the fly
** treating without 100% diagnosis
** think about what body systems are being impacted
* body systems
** respiratory system
*** nose, mouth, airway, lungs, diaphragm
*** things that could go wrong
**** liquid in the lungs
**** puncture to the lungs (rib or external)
**** choking on something or anything that blocks your airway
**** allergies and asthma - anaphalaxis
** cardiovascular system
*** heart, vessels
*** things that could go wrong
**** bleeding
***** some blood vessels are important (corodal, femeral arteries)
**** heart damage
**** blood clot / swelling
**** infection
** musculoskeletal system
*** things that could go wrong
**** sprain, strain, twisted ankle, jammed finger
**** break
** these other ones aren't going to be focusod on as much
*** integumetntary system
*** nervous system
*** digestive system
*** urinary system
*** reproductive system
*** endocrine system
*** lymphatic/immune system
* patient assessment
** scene saftey and sizeup
*** is this a safe situation for you to go into?
*** if you get hurt or sick, then you become a second patient
*** unsafe things like
**** a rock falling, bees, a clif, etc
*** personal protective equipment
**** gloves? goggles?
** ABCs (to address urgent issues)
*** Airway
**** problems
***** obstructed?
***** damage to the lungs?
**** ways to see (bad)
***** choking
***** coughing
***** wheezing
***** swelling
**** ways to see (good)
***** speaking / screaming (their airway is clear)
***** chest rise / fall (esp if laying down)
***** *pay attention to if this stops happening*
**** resolve it
***** heimlich maneuver (IF THEY ARE NOT COUGHING)
***** if coughing, KEEP COUGHING, pat on back
*** Breathing
**** problems
***** quality of breath (hyperventilation bad)
***** a tightening sound may indicate constriction of airway
**** ways to deal
***** for allergies / asthma - epipen/inhaler
****** they should administer it themselves if able
****** tripod position - lean them forwards or sitting up
****** a bag valve mask
*** Circulation
**** problems
***** puncture wounds or losing blood
**** look for
***** pulse
****** close pulses will be stronger, so a strong radial (wrist) pulse is good
**** ways to deal
***** IF HEART NOT BEATING (no pulse) cpr - chest compressions
***** major bleed
****** direct, well aimed pressure
****** presssure dressing
******* pack gauze on wound then wrap as tight as possible WITHOUT cutting off bloodflow
****** stuff the wound
****** turniquet
******* you won't really come across a situation where this is the best option
******* only happens in a severed or nearly severed limb (if its dangling/detatched)
******* the patient will lose a limb
*** Is there anything that will be a threat in five minutes?
** figuring out what is going on
*** overview
**** 'make a diagnosis' or as close to one as possible
*** history/SAMPLE
**** ask questions
***** what happened?
***** are you sick? did you eat something?
***** get the story of the day
*** head to toe
**** overview
***** look and listen to see what's going on
*** vital signs
**** overview
***** cues about how the body is doing
**** is
***** heart rate
****** typcally 60-100 for resting
****** might be up if they are hurt or panicked
***** respratory rate
***** blood pressure (unlikely to have the equipment)
***** pupils? bad if
****** head injury - maybe diff pupil size
****** not responding to light
****** really large
***** mental state
****** how conscious are they
** fix it
*** wound
*** break/strain
*** sickness
*** evacuation
* this vs that?
** break vs muscle strain
*** is it stable or not? can you walk on it / can you get yourself out?
** a closed break is not so bad but an open break is very bad
* situations
** minor wound / scrape
*** proirites
**** infection
***** area may be red, warm, throbbing, smell, leaking puss
***** how to clean a wound
****** first remove debris (dirt, pebbles) (tebridement)
****** flush with clean water (pressure behind water is good)
****** disinfectant (alchohol or peroxide)
******* dont put alchohol directly on an open wound (may dry it out)
******* use it around the wound on the skin
******* dab with alchohol splashed gauze (dont wipe)
******* thin layer for creams and ointments
***** bandage it if:
****** may get dirty again
****** if it might bleed again
****** maybe for comfort
****** otherwise, open air is better
**** bleeding control
** ankle/joint assesment
*** elevated vitals, swelling, says ankle got stuck between rocks and got twisted
*** maybe:break, strain, sprain, roll, etc
**** break
***** bone damage
**** strain / sprain
***** tendon or ligament damage
**** how to tell the difference
***** something in the middle of a limb, it's probably a break
***** something at a joint, it's usually a strain or sprain
***** breaks are point tender, strains/sprains are area tender
*** ask: can it be moved?
*** swollen, area pain, not much movement, from an ankle roll implies sprain
**** should use a splint (stop the movement, hold tight in a comfortable location)
**** can also use compression (stretchy bandage)
**** ice pack to help with swelling, or advil
*** to get out
**** is it stable? can she walk?
**** if not, call for the team with the litter/stretcher ('call for help with evacuation')
**** maybe use a sitting litter (put arms around someone and carry them out)
** environmental illness (very hot or very cold)
*** symptoms
**** shivering
**** slurred speach
**** weird walking / hand fumbles
**** mumbles, stumbles, fumbles, grumbles
**** *get out of wet clothing*
**** layers / blankets
**** have them move (not sweaty but warm)
**** warm or maybe sugary drink
** dehydration / hyperthermia
*** heat exhaustion
*** symptoms
**** if they feel hot
**** haven't had enough water
**** not able to regulate heat
**** dizzy/lightheaded
**** stumbling or spacey
**** stop sweating is very bad
*** hyponutremia
**** make sure they eat something (or get electrolytes) while drinking water
*** heat stroke
**** rare (deasert with no water for days)
* if you got lost
** it depends
*** what happened to get you lost
*** don't go offtrail, have a compass and map. tell someone where you are going and when you will be back!
*** can you backtrack safely, as that will be the best bet
**** don't wander because you may get more lost
*** get to higher ground visibly
* shock position
** use for keeping blood in people (if you are worried that they don't have enough blood in their system)
