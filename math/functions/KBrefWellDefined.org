* well defined                                                          :def:
  A function is well defined if each element of the domain has exactly one image. Formally,
  #+begin_quote
  A function $f : X \to Y$ is a relation $f$ from $X$ to $Y$ satisfying:
     1. $\forall x \in X$, $\exists y \in Y$ s.t. $(x, y) \in f$ (every element of the domain has an image)
	 2. $\forall x \in X$, $\forall y_1, y_2 \in Y$, $(x, y_1), (x, y_2) \in f$ implies $y_1 = y_2$ (each element of the domain has at most one image)

* counterexample
** $f(\frac{a}{b}) = a + b$
   This is actually not a well defined function, because $f(\frac{1}{2}) = 3$ while $f(\frac{2}{4}) = 6$, yet $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}$.
   This is actuall a really beautiful counter example.
