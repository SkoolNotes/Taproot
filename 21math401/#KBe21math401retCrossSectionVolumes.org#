#+TITLE: Volumes of shapes with known cross sections
* circular base with squares

  \[\begin{aligned}
   \int_{-a}^{a}  \left( 2\sqrt{a^2-x^2}\right)  ^2 dx &= 8\int_{0}^{a} a^2-x^2 dx
  \end{aligned}\]
* circular base with isocelese right triangle with hypotonuse on the base
  
  \[\begin{aligned}
   \int_{-a}^{a}  dx
  \end{aligned}\]
