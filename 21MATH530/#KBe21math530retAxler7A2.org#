Suppose $T \in  \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{F}$. Prove that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$ iff $\overline{\lambda}$ is an eigenvalue of $T^*$.

Given $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$, show that $\overline{\lambda}$ is an eigenvalue of $T^*$. This will imply both directions, since $\lambda = \overline{\overline{\lambda}}$ and $T = T^{*^*}$

Suppose $\mathcal{M}(T)$ is the matrix of $T$ wrt some orthonormal basis. Then, the matrix $\mathcal{M}(T^*)$ of $T^*$ wrt the same orthonormal basis will equal the conjugate transpose of $\mathcal{M}(T)$.

Eigenvalues lie on the diagonal of a matrix, so the transpose operation o


There exists some $v$ s.t.
\[\begin{aligned}
Tv = \lambda v
\end{aligned}\]


\[\begin{aligned}
 \langle \lambda v, w \rangle = \langle Tv, w \rangle = \langle v, T^* w \rangle
\end{aligned}\]
