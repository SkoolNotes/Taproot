True or false (and give a proof of your answer): The exists $T \in  \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{R}^3)$ s.t. $T$ is not self-adjoint but there is a basis of $\mathcal{R}^3$ consisting of eigenvectors of $T$.

The real spectral theorem suggests that if a map is self-adjoint, it must have an orthogonal basis of eigenvalues. Thus, we can choose a map which does not have an orthogonal basis of eigenvalues. For instance, choose the eigenvalues 
\[\begin{aligned}
T(1, 
\end{aligned}\]
