## Types of Numbers

algebra: 
```ad-qoute 
algebra is doing stuff to things
```

- idea of a number changes -- 500yago they didnt know about negs

natural numbers are the most natural, apparently
0 not in natural, 0 in whole

 $\mathbb{z}$ for integers, counting in german

rational numbers:  a/b $a,b \mathbb{e} \mathbb{z}$

real numbers: infinite all the way down
way more real numbers than rational numbers

- Zero: important for groups -- starting point on number lines. true neutral, **Additive Identity**
	- **Multiplicative Identity*: 1
	- identity lets it keep it's identity? when the op doesn't change
- negs: so we can deal with negs? so we can undo addition
```ad-tip
subtraction is a lie! add negs
subtraction on the natural numbers is not closed
```

```ad-def
closed: can make a number not in the set
```


## Groups

```ad-def
any set of mathematical elemements under one operation such that there is an identity each element has an inverse
```

- they do not need to be **communitive**
	- a+b = b+a
	
- **associativity**
	- (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)
	- order doesnt matter
	- most things we are doing will be associative
	- nice number systems are almost always associative


can add dimensions, like complex
adding more leads to quaternions or hamiltonians, then to sadonians?


## Matrices

- can be called an array
- 2d can use rows and columns as coords

#### operations:

addition: only if same dimensions, loop through indicies
dot:
cross: first row by first column
