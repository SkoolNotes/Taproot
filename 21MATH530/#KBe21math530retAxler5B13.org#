* Axler 5.B Exercise 13
  #+begin_quote
  Suppose $W$ is a complex vector space and $T \in  \mathcal{L} (W)$ has no eigenvalues. Prove that every subspace of $W$ invariant under $T$ is either $\{0\}$ or infinite-dimensional.

  5.21 states
  #+begin_quote
  Every operator on a finite-dimensional, nonzero, complex vector space has an eigenvalue.

  $W$ is given as a complex vector space, so to have no eigenvalues, it must be zero or infinite-dimensional. If the subspace is zero, then all subspaces must also be zero. Thus, only the infinite-dimensional case remains to be shown.

  By definition (5.14), for all subspaces $V$ of $W$ invariant under $T$, $T\big|_V$ exists in $\mathcal{L} (V)$.

  Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $V$ is nonzero and finite-dimensional. By 5.21, $T\big|_V$ has an eigenvalue. Then, there exists some \(\lambda \in \mathbb{C} \) and some $v \neq 0 \in V$ s.t.
  \[\begin{aligned}
  T\big|_V(v) = \lambda v
  \end{aligned}\]
  However, $T\big|_V$ is defined by $v \mapsto Tv$, which implies that
  \[\begin{aligned}
  Tv = T\big|_U(v) = \lambda v
  \end{aligned}\]
  for $v \neq 0 \in W$, which
