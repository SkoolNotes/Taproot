# Test :clap: review 👏 

[homework](https://nuevaschool.instructure.com/courses/3718/assignments/61290)

dot product -> scalar,
thus not closed!

we will learn about the determinant before the cross product


### system of equations
don't do substitution when doing lin alg
can represent system of equations with a matrix -- can solve with matricies
matrix of coef * the vars
advantage: cleaner, easier to enter into a computer

parralel systems 
```ad-tip
benifit in both directions -- understanding one helps us understand the other and vise versa
```

### questions
- |a| |b| costheta

- dot product to calc magnitude
	- dot by itself then sqrt

- system of equations with matricies, what do we multiply by
	- to mul row by x: take identity, swap out y index 1 with x
	- can just add, but not on the other side?
		- some type of decomp?
