[[KBxGroupAndMatricesIntro]]


```ad-def
field: group with + and * 
eg. complex #, real #
F: field -- usually real and/or complex
```

don't need to worry about distributivity!

we are gonna use a lotta fields and not a lot of groups

figure it out in low d then just aplly to high d

addition -> commutative in f1, extrapolate to fn
```ad-important
inhereted comutitivity!
```

3d vis on 2d means losing info, thus point has a line of points that all fall there

additive and multiplicative identity need to be separate!

any group with zero will not be groups under \*!
Q*=(Q\\{0}, \*) 
pluck out zero

### associativity check, with integers!

let $a,b,c \in Z$

goal:  $a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c$

$a + (b+c) = ( 1+1+1+1+...+1) = ( 1+1+1+1+...+1) + ( 1+1+1+1+...+1) + ( 1+1+1+1+...+1)$

and then scoot over?

### * 3x1 matrices

* equal indicies

no * everything by 1 cus ai !+ ia :(

dot and cross product
