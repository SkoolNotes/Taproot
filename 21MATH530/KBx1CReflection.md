## Reflection

**...and put any questions that arise in the text box for this assignment!**
some rough questions from my notes:
- How do disjoint unions work?
- What exactly is the significance of direct sums? I think I'm missing something here..
- Is V a subspace of itself, and thus cannot have a direct sum besides {0}?
- Woudn't the sum of two non {0} subspaces need to be infinite to contain all possible summands? Or do summands refer only to one addition operation?

### Also, please take a few minutes to reflect:
**what skills (template skills or others that seem pertinent) or habits have you used:**
- on the quizzes?
	- During the quizzes, I have of course had to use my knowledge of the content we have covered. 
	- As for studying for the quizzes, I generally 

- in class?

- for homework exercises?

- when reading?

Please give a few examples.
