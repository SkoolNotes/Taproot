## Reflection

**...and put any questions that arise in the text box for this assignment!**
some rough questions from my notes:
- How do disjoint unions work?
- What exactly is the significance of direct sums? I think I'm missing something here..
- Is V a subspace of itself, and thus cannot have a direct sum besides {0}?
- Woudn't the sum of two non {0} subspaces need to be infinite to contain all possible summands? Or do summands refer only to one addition operation?

### Also, please take a few minutes to reflect:
**what skills (template skills or others that seem pertinent) or habits have you used:**
- on the quizzes?
	- During the quizzes, I have of course had to use my knowledge of the content we have covered
	- As for studying for the quizzes, I generally review my notes prior, try to find the answers to my questions, then finally do some new exercises to find areas I don't understand well

- in class?
	- I have a lot of fun in Linear Algebra, so I'm generally focused and engaged in class
	- I try to balance asking questions based on my curiosity and disrupting the class / going on tangents
	- I take extensive notes in my classes, to the point of damaging my tendons when combined with my programming habits

- for homework exercises?
	- I generally get my homework done pretty soon after it is assigned, and I do my best to find good answers to the questions. However, I could spend more effort into making my homework clearer / prettier.
	- I ask and answer / talk about a lot of questions about the homework either in person with friends or on the Discord server I started and maintain. 

- when reading?
	- I try to take good notes when I'm reading which I reference often in class and with the homework. I sadly haven't been able to take notes on 1.C, which I'm not happy about
	- After I'm done reading, I do a few exercises then add them to my notes
	- All my notes go in a note sharing and linking ecosystem I created with my friends called Taproot which we take notes in then link together Wikipedia style
