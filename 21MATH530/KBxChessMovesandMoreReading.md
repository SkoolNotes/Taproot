## For tomorrow, think about the questions we raised in class:

Does a piece that can move up/down or diagonally with a slope of 1 get to anywhere on the plane?

What other possible move choices will allow a piece to go anywhere on the plane?

What about in THREE SPACE??

For next MONDAY, read 1.C!
