# Solving Systems

Read 1.B! Have questions. Try a couple exercises.
notes: [[KBxChapter1B]]

Also, keep thinking about the group work questions from today:

* **What is the relationship between cross product and the magnitude of a vector?**
	* Which vector? Assuming resultant vector, $||a||b|sin(\theta)|$ would be the magnitude

* **How does cosine relate to dot product? Can you prove it? (HINT: think about the previous problem and the Law of Cosines.)**
	* $a \cdot b = |a||b|cos(\theta)$
	* ![abcosthetaproof.pdf]

* **Do your best to solve the following matrix equation using matrix multiplications that correspond to row operations for systems, specifically multiplying a row by a scalar, adding two rows, and swapping the order of rows. You'll have to think about how to do these things with matrices! It may help to keep in mind what a SOLVED matrix equation looks like (in particular, what does the 3x3 matrix of coefficients look like?).**

$
	\begin{bmatrix} 
	1 & -1 & 1 \\
	0 & 2 & 1\\
	2 & 1 & -2 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\cdot
	\begin{bmatrix} 
	x \\
	y \\
	z \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	= 
	\begin{bmatrix} 
	-2 \\
	3 \\
	2 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
