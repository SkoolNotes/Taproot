# Solving Systems

Read 1.B! Have questions. Try a couple exercises.
%%notes: [[KBxChapter1B]]%%

Also, keep thinking about the group work questions from today:

*What is the relationship between cross product and the magnitude of a vector?

*How does cosine relate to dot product? Can you prove it? (HINT: think about the previous problem and the Law of Cosines.)

*Do your best to solve the following matrix equation using matrix multiplications that correspond to row operations for systems, specifically multiplying a row by a scalar, adding two rows, and swapping the order of rows. You'll have to think about how to do these things with matrices! It may help to keep in mind what a SOLVED matrix equation looks like (in particular, what does the 3x3 matrix of coefficients look like?).

	a & b & c \\
	c & d & d\\
	e & f & g \\
