# Grace's Meeting Notes
- Interested in memory
- Synapses are influencing each other => allows cluster processing => provide more insight
- Understanding brains+memory is key to understanding human behavior => excited about the mechanisms of the brain
-  Memory is interesting b/c its complex and we don't know about => personal and culture narratives are critical

***

- Like to talk about the causal pathways found
	- Figs 1, 8, 3
	- Personally want to focus on the background, observation, and pathways
	- General structure of presentation: Figures 1,8,3 between the structure of {Big pic, {hypo, result, pathway}, implication}
	
***

* Scientific story — what we talk about last time: the story of the LTP induced intra-synaptic PAP outflow cross talk
* Knew how signal strength could be changed + changes the likelyhood of neuron cross-talk => astroglia actually have an active role in memory encoding
* Paper complicates the preexisting definition of long term potentiation + pulls in novel information — that LTP is not just LTP but also influnces how other neurons fire
* New Figures!!
	* (old) 1, 8, 3
	* Figures 6C (nearby neurons are excited) and 8H (glutamate is dispersed more) => impact of the extra glutamate release 
	
* Master ordering of figures
	* Intro
	* Discovery
		* 1D — astroglia shrinking when LTP happened
	* Effect
		* 6C + 6H — why this would matter
	* Pathway
		* 3D — AQP4 astroglia changed the most when LTP, so that's causing it?
	*  Process
		* Redrawn 8D
	* Backup 	
		* 	1F — In backup to show control metric

Background stuff

- LTP: system how repeated firing of a synapse cause synapse to fire
- Glumate: involved in making neurons excited
- fEPSP: avg. amount of firing in a population of neurons
- VF: volume fraction
- MKCC1: protein — for neural remodeling
- Astroglia:

Personal Story — new way of conceptualizing memory.

- Memory Drives different behaviors — LTP is an interesting method of getting at how enviroments directly alter actions
- Direct pathway to what is experienced and the behavior
