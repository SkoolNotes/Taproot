* Not too much to walk about
* What's everyone up to?
	* Joint communal effort
	* Ellie dived into branding w/ identity + software
	* Juliet started on hardware

	* Read up + researched
	* Need to impliment: gyro to record, relay, and computer to identify tics
	* Subproblems
		* Recording => built in?
		* Relaying => BTLE
		* Labeling => tagging and organizing data
		* Reporting => UI/UX experience to end user
* No money problems until minimization + packaging
