- We read difficult texts in this class. What techniques did you use for getting the most out of readings and for formulating useful discussion points?
	- I approached the readings without assuming that what I was reading was 'thruthful.' This led me to analyse the texts more deeply, and forced me to only accept ideas that I had thought through. For discussion points, I tried to approach them with curiosity and ask one of many genuine questions that I was left with after doing the reading. 

- Our class is dependent on students engaging in discussions. What kind of role do you play in discussion, and what helps you be better at that role? What goals do you have for yourself in next semester’s discussions?
	- I would like to think I provide unique viewpoints to the discussion. Sometimes, unique viewpoints which reveal assumptions don't allow the class to progress through the material at the desired pace. Next semester, I hope to find a balance. 
	
- What kind of role did you play in your group project, the Bad Science presentation? What goals do you have for yourself in future group projects?
	- I played the role of a person working equally with their friends. 

- How might you apply what you learned in ISOS this fall to being a scientist in your science classes or to using scientific information to make informed choices as a citizen?
