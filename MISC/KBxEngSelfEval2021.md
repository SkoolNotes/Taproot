1) What did you discover about yourself as a learner in this class, especially since we transitioned to remote learning, and what do you feel was your greatest success?
	1) I learned that artwork is a good way to go about exploration. Sometimes it's hard to put ideas or truth into words; creating artwork around those ideas then reflecting on that artwork can often help understanding and reveal deeper truths. We went through this process with the Building Project, where trying to model the river forced us to understand it. We did this process again with the GoST Culminating Assignment, which I consider my greatest success this term in English class. 

2) What has been your greatest challenge in our class this term? This could be a specific text, assignment, or activity, a broader area or skill, or could be related to remote learning specifically.
	1) Speaking in class and in group discussions during remote learning is challenging. We do this a lot in English class. However, sharing ideas and discussing in chat has made learning a lot nicer, especially because English class does a good job of incorporating the chat.

3) Now that you're on the other end of our year-long English 10 course, what do you see as the value of studying colonial/postcolonial literature and the literature associated with globalization, environmentalism, and science communication?
	1) Without understanding the past we are doomed to repeat it. Also, by understanding where the remnants of the past exist in the modern day, we can create a better future.

4) What are your goals for English for next year and beyond? What is next? Please be specific in highlighting at least two goals and giving some sense of how you might meet them.
	1) I want to reduce the transition cost from my ideas to words on paper. This is something English class has already helped me do immensely, and something I want to continue improving on. The best way I have found to improve is with the practice given to me by English assignments. I also want to get better at analyzing poetry, something I found challenging and fun in the last unit. I'm going to try and do this by getting more practice.

Thanks for the wonderful term!
