            <ul>
            <li><p>What are the best and worst possible scores it could get?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>When using f1 score, the best possible score would be 1, and the worst would be 0.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>Why do you think the model is getting the score you’re seeing?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>The score I’m seeing is 1. This is expected, as I am testing a decision tree on the iris data it was trained on.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>How do the scores between the training and testing sets compare?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>I would assume that the testing set score would have a lower f1 score than the training set, as the model is specifically fitted for the training data.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h1 id="part-b">Part B</h1>
            <p>Please answer the following questions and briefly explain your answer:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Thinking about the R^2 metric used for evaluating regression, answer the following questions:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>What is the best highest possible score you could get?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>The highest possible score is 1, representing a perfect fit. In order to achieve an R^2 of 1, the error must be 0.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>If your model simply predicted the average value of the training set no matter what the input was, what score would you get on a test set whose average matched that of the training set?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>The score would be 0, as the denominator and numerator would be equal. This would result in the equation 1-1, which equals 0.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>What is the lowest score that you can get?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Negative infinity.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>When using accuracy to measure your model’s performance on a classification problem:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>What is the best possible score you could get?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><ol>
            <li><p>In a scenario with x samples, an entirely correct classification would lead to x/x, which is 1.</p></li>
            </ol></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>If your model always predicted the same class no matter what the input, what score would you get on a test set where 85% of the items were in that class?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>85%</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>What is the worst possible score you can get on a dataset that only has two classes?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><ol>
            <li><p>Every sample could be sorted incorrectly as long as there is more than one class.</p></li>
            </ol></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>A model gets a recall score of 0 for class A on a test set with classes A, B, and C. If you take one of the test items that is in class A and have this model predict what class it is, what will it predict?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>A recall score of 0 for class A means that every item in class A was labeled incorrectly. When given another sample in class A, the model will predict either class B or class C.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>A model gets a precision score of 1 for class A on a test set with classes A, B, and C. If you take one of the test items that is in class A and have your model predict what class it is, what will it predict?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>The model could predict any of the three classes. A precision value is only effected by true positive and false positive rate, meaning that when given a sample in class A, predicting C or B would not lower class A’s precision.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>If a model with classes A and B has an AUC score of 1 and you give it an item from the test set that is in class A, what class will it predict and what probability will it give for that class?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>It will predict class A, and give a probability of 100%. This is because an AUC score of 1 represents a perfect model.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>If a model with classes A and B has an AUC score of 0 and you give it an item from the test set that is in class A, what class will it predict and what probability will it give for that class?</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>This means that the model is always perfectly incorrect. If you were to give it a sample from class B, it will always pick class A, and vise versa. The model would still give a probability of 100%.</p></li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
