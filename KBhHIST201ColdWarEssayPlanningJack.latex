New accounts push past a bifurcated world to present the Cold War as a
triangular struggle between the two great powers and developing nations
to show how those involved in decolonization struggles adapted
strategies shaped by the Cold War dynamic.

Your task is to explore this triangular relationship within a single
case study. Your task is to analyze how your sources suggest a way to
capture this triangular cold war dynamic.

In a \textasciitilde4 page paper, evaluate how a global perspective for
the Cold War helps to understand events in your case study.

**How did the Cold War system shape development and/or decolonization in
your region?

  ``Beijing and Paris moved from military and political antagonism over
  the Indochina conflict in 1946-1954 and over the Algerian liberation
  struggle in 1954-1962 toward a partial alignment of views.'' AA
\item
  ``It was the shared uneasiness over the deteriorating situation in
  Vietnam and over the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), signed by the
  United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union in Moscow in
  early August 1963, that helped to usher in the process of
  recognition.'' AB
\item
  A five point reason for establishment of relationships as argued by
  historian historian Garret Martin L1

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``First, the end of the Algerian War in the spring of 1962 removed a
    major point of Sino-French conflict.'' L1A
  \item
    ``Second, the Cuban missile crisis in October ofthe same year
    revealed that neither superpower wanted global war. In turn, this
    provided new opportunities for medium powers to follow independent
    policies.'' L1B
  \item
    ``Third, Sino-French recognition was a natural follow-up to de
    Gaulle's attempts to break Anglo-American dominance in the West in
    early 1963 through the Franco-German treaty.'' L1C
  \item
    ``Fourth, de Gaulle perceived the LTBT of August 1963 as an attack
    on French global interests.'' L1D
  \item
    ``Finally, the political instability in South Vietnam in 1963
    brought China and France to agree in their criticism of Ngo Dinh
    Diem's regime.'' L1E
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  ``The shared nuclear isolation and the partial agreement on Vietnam in
  August 1963 by Beijing and Paris symbolized a new stage in the
  trajectory oftheir mutual relationship from antagonism toward mutual
  recognition'' AC
\item
  ``From the day the PRC was founded in the fall of 1949, it had striven
  for universal diplomatic recognition. Not only did this policy express
  the old nationalist aim ofrestoring China to its former glory and
  greatness in international relations; it also conveyed the aspiration
  ofthe Communist leaders to obtain recognition from non-Communist
  states, based on the ``principles of equality''" AD
\item
  ``The PRC explicitly warned the Soviet Union against assuming legal
  ``responsibilities in lieu of China. Even now, decades after the
  signing of the LTBT, Chinese publications still claim that the treaty
  deprived the PRC ofthe right to develop and test nuclear weapons.'' AE
\item
  ``President John F. Kennedy, who feared the Chinese acquisition
  ofnuclear weapons in 1962-1963, was at times more interested in the
  proliferation aspects of the treaty than in the banning of testing in
  multiple environments'' AF
\item
  ``De Gaulle was highly critical of the LTBT. In reality, however,
  France was not affected by the accord s provisions. The underground
  tests it was conducting in Algeria were permitted by the
  Soviet-British-American pact as the only way to test nuclear weapons.
  But the French president saw the trilateral agreement as yet another
  Yalta-style deal among the three most powerful countries on earth,
  concluded behind the backs ofless powerful states, and designed to
  preserve the three great powers' preeminent status in international
  relations'' AE
\item
  ``Even if France and the PRC disagreed on the future course with
  regard to Vietnam, they both believed in the necessity of U.S.
  political and military withdrawal from the country'' AF
\item
  ``The desire for recognition by the outside world also included the
  wish to join the UN and, as the ultimate goal, to take up the
  permanent seat ofthe ROC on the UN Security Council.'' AG
\item
  ``The PRC took pains to express its interest in better relations
  through some of its highest officials present at the Laos conference
  in Geneva.'' AH
\item
  ``The French ambassador had the strong impression that the PRC wanted
  to give the mutual relationship a ``new importance.'' The Chinese had
  extended a hand, and they believed it was now up to the French to
  accept it." AI
\item
  ``{[}Mao's{]} statement signified a departure from his earlier
  thinking on intermediate zones, which envisioned a Europe divided in
  halves belonging to either the socialist or the capitalist camp. But
  what did Maos new intermediate zone in Europe really mean? He claimed
  that the European countries were ``unhappy with the U.S. and the
  Soviet Union.'' AJ
\item
  ``As the LTBT negotiations in Moscow drew to a close---the concurrent
  Sino-Soviet party-to-party talks in that city, which were intended to
  bring about ideological reconciliation, had already ended in failure''
  AK
\item
  The French Foreign Ministry Asia Department Communique: ``Asia
  Department ofthe French Foreign Ministry prepared a report in early
  February 1961 advocating rapprochement with Communist China---for
  reasons of principle and practicality.'' L2

  \begin{itemize}

    ``The Chinese Communists had held de facto power over mainland China
    for more than ten years. The notion that the ROC in Taiwan \ldots{}
    was the legal representative of the Chinese people \ldots{} had long
    before turned out to be a fiction.'' L2A
  \item
    ``Since the end of the Indochina War in 1954---and despite the
    Algerian war---France and the PRC \ldots{} no longer had any reason
    to be antagonistic toward each other.'' L2B
  \item

    gravitating toward recognition ofmainland China, France had to
    appear to lead them in recognizing the PRC, otherwise it would lose
    influence in Africa.'' L2C

    trading partner in East Asia.'' L2D
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ``He explicitly remarked that the LTBT did not prevent the PRC or
  France from continuing nuclear testing. Expecting an imminent Chinese
  nuclear test, de Gaulle elaborated that once China had obtained
  nuclear capacities it would become a major actor in international
  relations.'' AL
\item
  ``Zhou concluded that the Sino-Soviet split and the temporary
  U.S.-Soviet rapprochement on nuclear issues had created the basis for
  a major rearrangement in international relations, which would
  logically include Sino-French rapprochement.'' AM
\item
  So why did Zhou decide this was a good idea? L3

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    They ``believed that rapprochement with the most important European
    continental power, France, would progressively lead to increased
    political and economic relations with other West European countries,

    simultaneously increasing China's international status.'' L3A
  \item
    ``Sino-French rapprochement would be beneficial in isolating and
    opposing U.S. imperialism on a global scale.'' L3B

    international relations.'' L3C
  \end{itemize}

  ``As de Gaulle saw it, France was willing to work for the admission
  ofthe PRC to the UN and to scale down French- Taiwanese relations to
  an informal level, but it was not willing to offer a French initiative
  to break relations with the ROC.'' AN
\item
  ``De Gaulle wanted both to proceed cautiously and to portray France as
  a great power unwilling to sub- mit to the dictates of any other
  country.'' AO
\item
  ``Zhou lauded France's decision to grant Algeria independence the year
  before and commented on the fact that both France and China, as
  aspiring nuclear powers, opposed the LTBT.'' AP
\item
  ``Zhou attempted to bring up the One-China principle, whereas Faure
  demanded the exclusion ofthe issue from this preliminary session.'' AQ
\item
  ``Faure insisted that de Gaulle would never take the initiative in
  breaking relations, so he suggested that France and the PRC simply
  exchange ambassadors, while the French govern- ment would downgrade
  the ROC representation in Paris to a level to be specified later.'' AR
\item
  ``The situation in Indochina had deteriorated further; the relations
  ofGreat Britain and the United States---France's two competitors for
  global influence---with the Southeast Asian countries had worsened in
  parallel.''" AU
\item
  ``De Gaulle parted from Faure with the comment that he would go
  through with French recognition of the PRC if his conversations in
  Washington did not change U.S. views\ldots. deGaulle's encounters with
  Johnson did not go well.'' AV
\item
  ``DeGaulle instructed deBeaumarchais \ldots{} only''to define a
  procedure: \emph{the simpler the better}"" AW
\item
  ``Zhou proposed a fourth procedure in case France was not able to
  agree to the One-China prin ciple. In that case, Li should state the
  Chinese position on the issue but not insist on the inclusion ofa
  sentence to that effect in any draft joint communique. \ldots{} de
  Beaumarchais insisted that France would not agree to any reference to
  the One-China principle in the joint communique. Li, following the
  instructions he had received, dropped the issue'' AX
\item
  ``if deBeaumarchais insisted on France maintaining a Two-China policy,
  Li was supposed to state clearly that such a position would mean a
  departure from earlier French positions and a sign ofdisrespect to the
  PRC, but Zhou's instructions did \emph{not} call for a termination
  ofnegotiations in such a case'' AY
\item
  ``De Gaulle's insistence on a simple text left the agreement vague
  with regard to the ROC on Taiwan.'' AZ

\textbf{Value-Based Decisions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The French approached Sino-French relations cautiously, not wanting to
  give in too much, and AO portray France as a great, unwilling to
  submit power
\item
  For instance, when

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    AQ Zhou tried to bring up One-China principle, and Faure said: No.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  is a scene where French were willing to risk inacceptance over their
  formal diplomatic relations

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    AR Faure maintained that deGaulle would never directly break RoC
    relations, and suggest waiting for RoC to break diplomatic contact
  \item
    AZ So, DeGaulle left it vague what they are going to do about 2
    china policy
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

w.r.t. ``Two China Policy'' --- a Chinese values-based demand --- the
French clearly pushed back and because there is no interest in them
giving up RoC relations, did not actively use it as a barganing chip.

\textbf{Realism-Based Decisions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AQ Zhou tried to bring up One-China principle, and Faure said: No.
\item
  AR Faure maintained that deGaulle would never directly break RoC
  relations, and suggest waiting for RoC to break diplomatic contact
\item
  AV last straw deGaulle tried to convince Johnson to do something about
  diplomacy with China. Johnson did not listen. So, deGaulle did
  diplomacy with China (connection BA)
\item
  AN deGaull thinks that the French is willing to help PRC go to UN and
  scale Franco-RoC relations down but not directly offer a breaking of
  Franco-RoC relations
\end{itemize}

However, given things that are realist tenants to what the French could
do to help china (UN), the French did not push back.

\textbf{Value-Based Reflections}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AE The actualy LTBT doesen't really matter to the French, but its more
  about deGaulle not wanting to be the dog of British-American-Soviet
  relations
\item
  L4C deGaulle also stressed that PRC recognition is not an approval of
  it policies/institutios
\item
  L2C the French need to set an example in approaching China, otherwise
  china is going to approach the Indep. French colonies first, which
  would be awkward
\item
  AL deGaull know that LTBT did not prevent PRC/France from trying
  Kaboom; so, expecting China to try blowing things up soon, deGaull
  reasoned that China will soon become a superpower once they could make
  things go Kaboom.
\end{itemize}

The French wanted to help China as a way of advacing its own
nationalistic goals in the department of international leadreship and
representation.

\textbf{Realism-Based Reflections}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AI the french ambassidor had the impression that ``The Chinese had
  extended a hand, and they believed it was now up to the French to
  accept it.''"
\item
  L1B cuban missle crisis showed that american/russia did not want to
  make world go kaboom, so medium states feel better to persue
  independent policies
\item
  L4A deGaull thinks that China's large economy no longer controlled by
  USSR is a fact of life, so \#dealwithit
\item
  L4B deGaull reasoned that it would be impossible to solve the East
  Asia problem w/o China
\end{itemize}

The French also see that China being in asia as a fact of life, so they
have to \#dealwithit; might as well do so whilst it is so fresh and
China is open to it.

\hypertarget{chinese-view}{%
\paragraph{Chinese View}\label{chinese-view}}

\textbf{Value-Based Decisions}

Conspicuously missing.

\textbf{Realism-Based Decisions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AE PRC did not want USSR to represent China wrt LTBT b/c of
  discontent; to this day PRC claim LTBT deprived them of nuclear
  development rights
\item
  AK the reconciliation between Moscow and Beijing did a die after LTBT
  negotiations in Moscow (connection BA)
\item
  L3A Zhou believed that reappoarchment with France will eveuntally
  cause US to stop blocading PRC + increase Chineses status
\item
  AX Zhou decided that if the French was really not up to the one-china
  thing in the comminque, it is ok to just drop it. the French was no
  ok, so they dropped it!
\item
  AY Zhou was even open to negotiatinos even if deBeaumarchais (deGaull
  + friends) wanted to maintain a Two-China policy
\end{itemize}

China wanted to use realistic strategies that may not necessarily align
with its political goals to advance its goals of getting a ``spot in the
light'' ideologically.

\textbf{Value-Based Reflections}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AD China drove for diplomatic recognition from capitalists from day
  one aiming to restore nationalist glory and the ``principles of
  equality''
\item

  and Soviet stance (connect CA)
\item
  L3C china could align with French's National Independence to break
  superpower monopoly
\item
  L3B Sino-French corroporation will oppose US + imperialism
\end{itemize}

China reasoned that the Cold War will probably splinter Europe and cause
smaller European countries to resist superpower monopoly. Hence,
partnership with France will break the imperialistic and capitalistic
systems.

\textbf{Realism-Based Reflections} - AM Zhou Enlai concluded that he
Sino-Soviet split + US Soviet Nuclear Reapporachment (\textbf{product of
the cold war??}) means that international BoP will change soon, so might
as well build relations with France (connect CA)

Realistically, China believed that the cold war's BOP shift will offer
them a chance to have some skin in the game.

More better question: how does the Cold War influence the Franco-Chinese
balance of Ideloogy vs.~Pragmatism?

Asserting a French power to reaffirm the ``specialness'' of France
=\textgreater{} nationalism! Not ideology.

Maintainence of ideological commitments as a means to National
preeminence =\textgreater{} ideology is trans-national

  In the 1960s, CW dynamics created an timely opportunity for china + us
  to assert national position on the international stage
\item
  To do so, however, countries had to balance values and pragmatism in
  order to ultimately support their goal of doing so.

How does the Chinese people get sold on the idea of establishing
relationships with the French? Was it authoritarianism?

How does nationalism inform the decision between deGaulle and Mao?
deGaulle's wish to play/dominate European politics + Mao's wish to
establish ``principles of equality'' =\textgreater{} both sentiments of
Nationalism.

Perhaps both states employed \emph{realpolitik} treatment to politics
and to advanced their state goals.

Cold war stabilshed a balance between pragmatism and ideology, and
reality does/does not matter?

Revolutionary seniments used and the sense of ``fellow revolutionary''
mentality as a tool to persue a realist sense of partnership
