* Types of micro (point) mutations

** insert/remove
*** frameshift mutation
**** deletion/insertion that nets a non-multiple of 3, so the codons don't line up anymore
**** everything downstream is "corrupted"
** substitute
*** missense mutation
**** changes an amino acid to another amino acid
*** nonsense mutation
**** changes an amino acid to a stop codon
*** silent mutation
**** does not change an amino acid
* macro mutations
** deletion of a large chunk
** duplication of a large chunk
** inversion of a large chunk (reverses it)
** substitution (move a chunk elsewhere)
** translation?
* comparison
** micro mutations tend to happen and then cause macro mutations, both can cause cancer
