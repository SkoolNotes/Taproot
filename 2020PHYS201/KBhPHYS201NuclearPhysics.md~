# Nuclear Physics
First of all, recall [[KBhPHYS201ColoumbsLaw]]. Given the force between two particles is $\frac{kQ^2}{R^2}$, we could hand-wavily calculate the _work_ between two particles if we know how much they travel near/far from each other. Through this, we could show that nuclear forces (through nuclear distance, proton=>electron) are much larger than that of the chemical forces (atom/atom, electron=>electron).

#compilefromnote

Remember: $A_{nucl} = \frac{1}{10^{10}} A_{atom}$

## Radioactivity
Radiation is the emition of waves — lights, heat, etc. etc. We call something "radioactive" if it emits ionizing radiation: that it has enough energy to liberate an electron from an atom.

### Geiger Counter
#inserthowgeigercountersowrk

Because of the fact that Geiger counters require time to discharge, there is a certain rate called "dead time" during which Geiger counters simply sit and do nothing. As such, we have to account for this lossy "deadtime" of Geiger counters by relating the two values with the following equation

$T = \frac{M}{1-(M/L)}$, where $M$ is the measured rate of radiation and $L$ is the "dead time" — the upper limit of the Geiger counter in question.

### Radio Charge Types

- $\alpha$: positively charged + relatively massive (low $\frac{q}{m}$)
- $\beta$: negatively charged + relatively high charge (high $\frac{q}{m}$)
- $\gamma$: neutral

This could be seen by how these three types of charge curve into a magnetic field.

Why? Apply right hand rule 1.5.


### Creating a ray
"Split a nucleus, somehow"

**Alpha Decay**:

![](alphadecay.png)

During alpha decay, a massive nucleolus spits out a Helium-resulting part of itself to get rid of 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So, formally...

**Gamma Decay**

Instead of splitting part of the nucleus, gamma decay spits an electrically excited (so... chemistry, charged, energy level, that stuff) atom into a normal, non-excited atom and also emits a photon.

And now, the most confusing one...

**Beta Decay**
There's two types of beta decay: "beta-minus" decay and "beta-plus" decay. When folks talk about just "beta-decay", they are talking about beta-minus decay.

An element decays from the parent element into a different nucleus.

_Beta minus decay_

![](betaminusdecay.png)

In this case, the nucleus gained a proton and lost a neutron. 

What happened? A neutron in the nucleus turned into a positive proton and a negative electron. The newly-formed electron comes flying out as a "beta-minus" particle. Also, this process creates an "antineutrino", which is a tiny, charge-less element that will become important later.

_Beta plus decay_

![](betaplusdecay.png)

This is the opposite of beta-minus decay. The element takes one of its protons, splits it to a positron (a positive electron, this is antimatter), a neutrino, and a neutron.

Wait... But _how_?

![](betadecaybackwards.png)

Beta-minus decay makes sense, because it would been energetically favorable as a neutron is _slightly_ more massive and hence will loose some of the mass during beta-minus decay. But, during beta-plus decay, the reactants are less massive than the product (!!) --- so thermally it won't really work out.

![](betadecayisreallybackwards.png)

So, in order to actually create beta-plus decay, you have to shove the protons, antimatter, etc. together really fast with some kinetic energy. Or, this could happen spontaneously as long as the mass of the daughter atom is smaller than the mass of the parent (as in... as long as mass of daughter + mass of anti electron + mass of neutrino < mass of parent, this should work.) 

To make sense of this, stop thinking that atoms' masses could be deducted by just counting the number of neutrons+protons.

_Electron capture_

![](electroncapture.png)

In this case, you will gain one neutron by simply capturing an electron out of thin air (the electron cloud) and merge it with a proton to form a neutron and an antineutrino.

So, together...
