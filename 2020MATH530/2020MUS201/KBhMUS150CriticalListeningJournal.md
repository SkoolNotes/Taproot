**Electric — Alina Baraz**

 - Interesting EQ choice on vocals
 - Syncth panning automation?
 - Vocal filtering action
 - Drum machine being filtered too
 - A LOT of filtering on vocals during chorus + backing vocals being synthesized instead of sung?
 - Male chorus seems to be eqed for bases w/ a pretty low HP

 - Ending rain SFX + a mids-only sonud effect
 - More wobbly filtering synth
