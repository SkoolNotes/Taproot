# intro

## speaking is important

## tutorial: probably tuesdays and thursdays at lunch

# isomorphisms

## an invertible / bijective map from one vetorspace to another

## an operator (map from a vector space to itself) is bijective iff it is surjective or injective

# 3D Exercises

## Axler3D.3

### suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional, $U$ is a supspace of $V$, and $S \in \mathcal L(U, V)$. Prove there exists an invertible operator $T \in \mathcal L(V)$ s.t. $Tu = Su$ for every $u \in U$ iff $S$ is injective

### maybe $S$ needs to be an operator on $\mathcal L(U)$?
