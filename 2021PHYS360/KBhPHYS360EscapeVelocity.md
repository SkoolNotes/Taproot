# Earth's Gravitatonal Field
Extends infinitely large, but there is a point whereby it is imperceivable.

First, *Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation*.

$\vec{F_g} = -\frac{M_2 M_1 G}{R^2} \cdot \hat{r}$, where $G$ is the Universal Gravity Constant and $r$ is a direction ("unit vector") tha points from $M_1$ to $M_2$ (so $\hat{r} = \frac{\vec{r}}{r}$). 

Often, this is written as...

$\vec{F_g} = \frac{-G M_1 M_2}{r^3} \vec{r}$. It is $r^2$, but doing this and multiplying it to $\vec{r}$ is to resolve the need to rid if the direction.
