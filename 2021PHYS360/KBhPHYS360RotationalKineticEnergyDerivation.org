* Position of $m_i$
In a rigid body consisting of $N$ point masses, the vector to the position of $m_i$ is defined as $\vec{r_i(t)}$, which is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{r_i(t)} = \vec{R_{CM}(t)} + \vec{r_i}'(t)
\end{equation}

whereas, $\vec{R_{CM}(t)}$ is the position vector of the center of mass of the rigid body as a whole, and $\vec{r_i}'(t)$ the vector from the center of mass to $m_i$.

* Velocity of $m_i$
The velocity of $m_i$ is simply determined by the first derivative of the position equation as per above. Namely, that:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{v_i(t)} = \vec{V_{CM}(t)} + \vec{v_i}'(t)
\end{equation}

where, $\vec{v_i(t)}$ is the velocity vector of $m_i$, and $\vec{V_{CM}(t)}$ is the velocity vector of the center of mass of the rigid body, and $\vec{v_i}'(t)$ is the velocity vector from center of mass to $m_i$.

* Deriving $KE_{total}$
From definition of $KE_{total}$ itself, $KE_{total}$ is the sum of all energies of each point mass in the rigid body.

\begin{equation}
    \sum^N_{i=1} \frac{1}{2}m_iv_i^2
\end{equation}
