* A review of what happened before

\begin{align}
PE &= mg \Delta h \\
KE &= \frac{1}{2} mv^2
\end{align}

But, really, the definition of kinetic energy is a bit of a lie. Because really, its actually the following thing:

\begin{equation}
KE_{total} = KE_{translational} + KE_{rotational}
\end{equation}

Where, $KE_{rotational} = \frac{1}{2}MV^2$ we already know. 

But, rotational around the CM
