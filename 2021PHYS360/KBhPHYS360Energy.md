So let's talk about energy!

# Types of Energy
* Potential Energy $PE_{grav}=mgh$ (which is work (force times distance) for moving stuff up $\vec{F} \cdot \vec{h}$)
* Kinetic Energy $KE_{translational} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$  + $KE_{rotational} = \frac{1}{2}I \omega^2$

Where...

- $I$: moment of inertia
- $\omega$: rotational velocity

# Work
$W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d}$, where $\vec{F}$ force and $\vec{d}$ change of distance that the force manifest.

=> $W = |\vec{F}|\cos{\theta} \times |\vec{d}|$

which, => $W = |\vec{d}|\cos{\theta} \times |\vec{F}|$

so, essentially,  work is either displacement times parallel as part of force, or visa versa.

Why? 

## The Dot Product, a review
### What is it
The Dot product is a measure of the "pararllelity" of $\vec{F}$ with $\vec{D}$.  

=> Dot product: the component of the first vector parallel to the second vector multiplied to the magnitude of d.

$\vec{A} \cdot \vec{B} = |\vec{A}||\vec{B}|\cos{\theta}$

### Calculating it
Given two vectors

- $\vec{V_1} = <a_x, a_y, a_z>$
- $\vec{V_2} = <b_x, b_y, b_z>$

The dot product is...

$\vec{V1} \times \vec{V2} = a_x b_x + a_y b_y + a_z b_z$


# Potential Energy
Potential energy exists because of a force field. There is an object "propping" it up pending release of energy.

## Where did $\Delta PE = W = mg \Delta h$ come from?

So, define $PE = -W_{AB}$.  Which is "potential energy of A to B." Gravity will do a certain amount of work from one point to anther, it will do the opposite the other way.

$\Delta PE_g = -W_{AB} = -\vec{F} \cdot \vec{d}$

$\Delta PE_g = -((-mg) \cdot \Delta h)$ The negative again! $\ is
