* Escape Velocity and Gravitational Potential Energy

** Newton's Universal Gravitation Law
\begin{equation}
\vec{F_g} = - \frac{GM_1M_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
\end{equation}

where, $\vec{F_g}$ is the force of gravity on $M_2$; $M_1$ and $M_2$ are two point masses; $G$ the universal gravitation constant; $r$ the magnitude of the vector $\vec{r}$ from $M_1$ to $M_2$ and $\hat{r}$ the unit vector in the $\vec{r}$ direction.

** Equation for Gravitational Potential Energy

*** Needed Definitions
To begin, we need to modify the [[*Newton's Universal Gravitation Law][Newton's Universal Gravitation Law]] to fit the parameters of the scenario. Namely, we need to treat both Earth and our object as point masses, and assign $M_1$ to be Earth and $M_2$ to be our object.

Also, it is necessary to define the coordinate system: that our object, $M_2$, is defined to be to the /left///more negative/ side of the coordinate compared to the location occupied by the Earth, $M_e=M_1$ (as, per the problem, the "zero" point is set at $r = \infty$.)

With this assumption, we could therefore claim $\vec{r}$ to be pointing from the origin to the /negative/ side of the axis, rendering it represented by the value $-1$ for this system.

Hence, with the necessary variable substitutions as highlighted before, we arrive at the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\vec{F_{em}}(r) = \frac{GM_eM_2}{r^2}
\end{equation}

*** Deducing Gravitational Potential energy

The general equation for work is as follows:

\begin{equation}
W = F(x) dx
\end{equation}

In this case, as we will be deducing the total gravitational potential energy as per the setup above, we need to be integrating upon $\vec{F_{em}}(r) dr$. Hence, the integral --- with bounds $[0,\infty]$ --- is therefore:

\begin{equation}
W = \int_0^\infty{\frac{GM_eM_2}{r^2} dr}
\end{equation}

Determining the total gravitation potential energy will therefore involve evaluating the integral:

\begin{align}
W = \int_0^\infty{\frac{GM_eM_2}{r^2} dr}
W = GM_eM_2 \int_0^\infty{\frac{}{r^2} dr}
\end{align}
