* Impulse
Impulse is the transference of momentum (like how Work is the transference of energy):

\begin{align}
impuse &= \int \vec{F} dt \\
&= \Delta \vec{\rho}
\end{align}

It is very similar to the Work equation, and but it is instead integrating on change of Time.

Just in case you forgot:

\begin{equation}
\vec{\rho} = m\vec{V}
\end{equation}
