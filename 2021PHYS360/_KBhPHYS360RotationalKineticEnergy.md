```{=latex}
\begin{align}
PE &= mg \Delta h \\
KE &= \frac{1}{2} mv^2
\end{align}
```
But, really, the definition of kinetic energy is a bit of a lie. Because
really, its actually the following thing:

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
KE_{total} = KE_{translational} + KE_{rotational}
\end{equation}
```
Where, $KE_{rotational} = \frac{1}{2}MV^2$ we already know.

But, rotational around the CM
