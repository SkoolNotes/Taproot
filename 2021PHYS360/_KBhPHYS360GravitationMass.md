# Escape Velocity and Gravitational Potential Energy

## Newton\'s Universal Gravitation Law

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
\vec{F_g} = - \frac{GM_1M_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
\end{equation}
```
where, $\vec{F_g}$ is the force of gravity on $M_2$; $M_1$ and $M_2$ are
two point masses; $G$ the universal gravitation constant; $r$ the
magnitude of the vector $\vec{r}$ from $M_1$ to $M_2$ and $\hat{r}$ the
unit vector in the $\vec{r}$ direction.

Also, introduce the following variables:

-   $M_e$ for the mass of the Earth
-   $g$ for the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the Earth

## Equation for Gravitational Potential Energy

The general equation for work is as follows:

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
W = \frac{dF}{dx} dx
\end{equation}
```
To begin, we need to modify the [*Newton\'s Universal Gravitation
Law*]{.spurious-link target="*Newton's Universal Gravitation Law"} to
fit the parameters of the senario. Namely, we need to treat both Earth
and our object as point masses, and assign $M_1$ to be Earth and $M_2$
to be our object.

Also, it is necessary to define the coordinate system: th
