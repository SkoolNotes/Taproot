# Escape Velocity and Gravitational Potential Energy

## Newton\'s Universal Gravitation Law

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
\vec{F_g} = - \frac{GM_1M_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
\end{equation}
```
where, $\vec{F_g}$ is the force of gravity on $M_2$; $M_1$ and $M_2$ are
two point masses; $G$ the universal gravitation constant; $\vec{r}$
