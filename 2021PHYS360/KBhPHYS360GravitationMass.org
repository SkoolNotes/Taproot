* Escape Velocity and Gravitational Potential Energy

** Newton's Universal Gravitation Law
\begin{equation}
\vec{F_g} = - \frac{GM_1M_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
\end{equation}

where, $\vec{F_g}$ is the force of gravity on $M_2$; $M_1$ and $M_2$ are two point masses; $G$ the universal gravitation constant; $r$ the magnitude of the vector $\vec{r}$ from $M_1$ to $M_2$ and $\hat{r}$ the unit vector in the $\vec{r}$ direction.

Also, introduce the following variables:
- $M_e$ for the mass of the Earth
- $g$ for the acceleration of gravity on the surface of the Earth

** Equation for Gravitational Potential Energy
The general equation for work is as follows:

\begin{equation}
W = \frac{dF}{dx} dx
\end{equation}

To begin, we need to modify the [[*Newton's Universal Gravitation Law][Newton's Universal Gravitation Law]] to fit the parameters of the senario. Namely, we need to treat both Earth and our object as point masses, and assign $M_1$ to be Earth and $M_2$ to be our object.

Also, it is necessary to define the coordinate system: th
