# Experiments
Basically, we just rubbed a bunch of things on each other and checked the resulting charge with an electrometer.

## Interesting results
- Combs are great for static electricity
- Rubbing some objects on others caused similar charges, while other object caused different charges
- These notes are in hindsight so I legit don't remember too much

# Explanation
- Opposite charges attract; similar charges repel
- When charged object is brought close to a conductor, electrons in the conductor will flow and polarize the conductor
- When charged object is brought close to an insulator, atoms inside the insulator will be polarized. With small objects, this can make the whole object be basically polarized.
- When a charged object makes contact with a conductor, the electrons will be shared between objects.

# Homework
## Lecture Notes

Might not be complete.

### Electrostatics Basics
- There are Insulators and Conductors
	- Insulators: Don't share electrons
	- Conductors: Share electrons
	- Learn why this is in solid state physics
- List of charges when rubbed
	- Plastics usually become negative
	- Fur, elastics usually become positive
- Electrons can be shared between materials
- Electrons can move somewhat freely (depending on the material) within an object
	- Especially when close to another charged object!
- Even in materials where electrons can't move freely (e.g. paper, other insulators), polarization can cause a "chain reaction" and "polarize" the object as a whole

### Quantification
- Coulomb's Law
	- Given two point charges, Q1 and Q2, and a distance r
	- $F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$
		- $k$ is $8.99\times 10^{9}Nm^{2}C^{-2}$
		- $r$ is in meters
		- $q_1$, $q_2$ in Coulombs ($C$)
		- if $F > 0$, then force is repulsion
		- if $F < 0$, then force is attraction
	- Sample Problem: Find distance ($r$) given $q_1$, $q_2$, and $F$
$$
\begin{aligned}
q_1 &= 50uC &= 50\times 10^{-6}C \\
q_2 &= 1uC &= 1\times 10^{-6}C \\
F_{12} &= 2N \\
k &= 8.99\times 10^{9}Nm^{2}C^{-2} \\
F &= k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} \\
r^2 &= k \frac{q_1q_2}{F} &= 8.99\times 10^{9}Nm^{2}C^{-2} \cdot 50\times 10^{-12}C^{2} \div 2N \\
&= 224.75 \times 10^{-3}m \\
r &= \sqrt{224.75 \times 10^{-3}}m \\
&= 474\times 10^{-3}m
\end{aligned}
$$

	- In more complicated setups, certain things such as acceleration won't be constant because it is determinant on force, which is determined by distance from other charges.
		- This complicates things so don't expect it to be simple.

### Vector Fields
- Fields of vectors
	- Vector magnitude is in $NC^{-1}$ (Newtons per Coulomb)
	- Behave in interesting ways i guess i dunno
	- Calculate using a hypothetical proton
