# Experiments
Basically, we just rubbed a bunch of things on each other and checked the resulting charge with an electrometer.

## Interesting results
- Combs are great for static electricity
- Rubbing some objects on others caused similar charges, while other object caused different charges
- These notes are in hindsight so I legit don't remember too much

# Explanation
- Opposite charges attract; similar charges repel
- When charged object is brought close to a conductor, electrons in the conductor will flow and polarize the conductor
- When charged object is brought close to an insulator, atoms inside the insulator will be polarized. With small objects, this can make the whole object be basically polarized.
- When a charged object makes contact with a conductor, the electrons will be shared between objects.

# Homework
## Lecture Notes

### Electrostatics Basics
- There are Insulators and Conductors
	- Insulators: Don't share electrons
	- Conductors: Share electrons
	- Learn why this is in solid state physics
- List of charges when rubbed
	- Plastics usually become negative
	- Fur, elastics usually become positive
- Electrons can be shared between materials
- Electrons can move somewhat freely (depending on the material) within an object
	- Especially when close to another charged object!
- Even in materials where electrons can't move freely (e.g. paper, other insulators), polarization can cause a "chain reaction" and "polarize" the object as a whole

### Quantification
- Coulomb's Law
	- Given two point charges, Q1 and Q2, and a distance r
	- $F = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$
		- k is 8.99 * 10^9 Nm^2C^-2
		- r is in meters
		- q1, q2 in Coulombs (C)
		- if F>0: force is repulsion
		- if F<0: force is attraction
	- Sample Problem
		$q_1 = 50uC = 50\times 10^-6C$
		$q_2 = 1uC = 1\times 10^-6C$
		$F_12 = 2N$ ()
		k = 8.99*10^9Nm^2C^-2
		F = k * (q1q2/r^2)
		r^2 = k * (q1q2/F) = 8.99*10^9Nm^2C^-2 * 50*10^-12C^2 / 2N
		= 224.75 * 10^-3 m
		r = sqrt(224.75 * 10^-3)m 
		= 474*10^-3m
	- In more complicated setups, certain things such as acceleration won't be constant because it is determinant on force, which is determined by distance from other charges.
		- This complicates things so don't expect it to be simple.
