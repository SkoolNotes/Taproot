            <p>(“black” =&gt; opaque): from solid materials, liquids</p>
            <p>The radiation from hot, solid materials looks samey (bright yellow) unlike every gas, however, had a spectral emission (think - neon lights.)</p>
            <p>But!</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210303111558.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>The light spectrum did depend on temperature, so what happened? Why is everything hot?</p>
            <p><strong>Max Plank</strong> =&gt; trying to model incoming light source from rays as basically all absorbed and not bounced back.</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210303111810.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>Max Plank’s Model 1 in this manner matched well with observations at long wavelengths (red hot). But, it predicted infinite brightness (it will just “keep bouncing”) as wavelength =&gt; 0, which is wrong. This is the “ultraviolet catastrophie.”</p>
            <p>So, he made it better.</p>
            <p>Max Plank’s Model 2 is just Model 1, but an additional assumption that when Energy Transfers from e^- to EMWave, <span class="math inline">\(\delta E\)</span> must be some constant * frequency of light.</p>
            <p>So, to synthesize high frequencies, this cop out had the effect of supressing the infinite growth as <span class="math inline">\(\delta E\)</span> would grow bigger and bigger to the point where all your energy would not go into the EMWave but to this transferring factor.</p>
            <p>Which is like… Kind of a cop out. But it did fit medium frequencies better.</p>

            <p>Einstein =&gt; Light != “wave”; instead, light are photon particles moving through space.</p>
            <p><strong>Impontant Knowledges::</strong></p>
            <p>Energy of each photon is equal to the plank constant (h) times the frequency (f). <span class="math inline">\(E = h*f\)</span>.</p>

            <p><span class="math inline">\(E_{photon} = h \times f\)</span></p>
            <p>Instead of Hertz, however, the frequency of F could better be represented with <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, a unit of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{radians}{sec}\)</span> that is derived as <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi f (\frac{radians}{s})\)</span></p>
            <p>So to calculate energy with <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, simply use <span class="math inline">\(\bar{h} = \frac{h}{2\pi}\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(E = \bar{h}\omega\)</span></p>

            <p>If <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> is small, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta E\)</span> is large.</p>

            <p>If you take a piece of conductor, for instance, a metal, and shine a EM radiation on it (a light), you will know that there is a possiblilty for electrons to escape the surface</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210310112755.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>Most effective way of doing this: large Force, and shine for a long time.</p>
            <p><strong>Wrong but intuitive</strong>:</p>
            <p>Large force =&gt; large electric field =&gt; bright light. Long wavelength light =&gt; long time =&gt; red light.</p>
            <p><strong>But!</strong> Long wavelength light, no matter how bright, ejected nothing. Short wavelength light, no mater how dim, ejected electron.</p>
            <p>Kinetic energy of the ejected electrons was related to the frequency of the electron used. Higher frequencies gave electrons more frequency.</p>
            <p>The brightness of light only had to do with electrons/sec. If you make the light brighter, you just get more of electrons, but they have the same energy.</p>
            <p>this is because….</p>
            <p><strong>Light is a particle! A photon.</strong></p>
            <p>Each photon has an energy porportional to its frequency; that is, <span class="math inline">\(E=hf\)</span>, where f is plank’s constant and f the frequency.</p>
            <p>So each e- in metal interacts with one photon at a time.</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210310113322.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>A certain minimum amonut of energy is needed for electron to escape. The minimum escape energy is called the “<strong>work function</strong>” of the metal.</p>
            <p>Electron will be ejected as long as your kinetic energy gets there.</p>
            <p>Energy of yoru photons goes to two places =&gt; satisfying the work function + Kinetic energy of the ejected electron</p>
            <p>Hence: <span class="math inline">\(h \times f = WF + KE_{e^-}\)</span>, where WF is the work function of the material, and h, planks constant, f is the frequency</p>
            <p>To measure the ejection, you need to chuck the whole apparutus in a vaccume. Because if there are air molecules, it would absorbe the electrons.</p>
            <p>To continually eject electrons (otherwise, you would eject a few, your metal becomes positive, and no more electrons for you), you also need to collect the ejected electrons and put them back into the metal.</p>
            <p>To figure out the amount of kinetic energy, simply figure out how much voltage need to be added to stop the protons. If the stopping voltage is small, it will need to fight the voltage but completes the circut. As you increase the stopping voltage, you want to figure out when the electrons don’t have enough energy to complete the circut.</p>
            <p>Increase Vstop untill current drops to 0.</p>
            <p><span class="math inline">\(V_{stop} \times Q_e = KE\)</span>. The kinetic energy of ejected electrons is charge of an electron times the stopping voltage multiplied by.</p>
            <p>Finally, plugging stuff into the previous hf equation: <span class="math inline">\(h \times f = WF + Q_e \times V_{stop}\)</span></p>
            <p>Quarks combine their fractional charges into particles of full charge. The number of leptos (electron, muon, yadda) and bayons (neutron, proton, pion, yadda) should be conserved though a decay</p>

            <p>Bohr Model: gets right — energy level of Hydrogen</p>
            <p><del>For every N, we have a unique energy + a unique angular momentum.</del></p>
            <p>Turns out, for every N, there are a variety of angular momentum that’s possible</p>
            <p>Bohr’s circular orbit and definite position theories are definitely wrong.</p>
            <p>There is, however, a maximum angular momentum for each N in units of H-bar.</p>

            <p>This equation is only useful if the particle is moving along on a potential.</p>
            <p>As time increases, the potential does not change in time</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210322094031.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>The function <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> solution to schodinger’s equation in probably imaginary, but, multiplied by its complex conjugate, we could find the probability density that the particle will be found at (x).</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210322094217.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>And given that its a probability density, we know a few things</p>
            <p><span class="math inline">\(\int_{-\infty}^{infty} \phi * \phi dx = 1\)</span> because “if you look everywhere, you otta find it if it exist.”</p>
            <p><span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)\)</span> must be continuous.</p>
            <p>The phi function must follow the property of being “bounded”, meaning that <span class="math inline">\(\phi {x&lt;0 \rightarrow 0, x&gt;L =&gt; \rightarrow}\)</span></p>
            <p>Solving for the differential equation that we proposed:</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210322095234.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>But wait! B squared here resulted in an negative number. That’s either imaginary (which actually works out because <span class="math inline">\(e^i = sin\)</span>, think talor), or we just use a different function:</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210322095510.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>But! Remember that this function is bounded between 0 and L. Hence, we add multiple wave functions together like standing waves.</p>
            <p>Continuity at X=L demand <span class="math inline">\(B*L = N*\pi\)</span>, whereby <span class="math inline">\(N=interger\)</span>. B !=0 because otherwise the particle would be just nonexistant anywhere.</p>
            <p>For each N, a new standing wave is added. So the collapsed sum of the wave functions would be the probablitiy densities.</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210322100145.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>On classical physics, the probability of oscellations should be constant (the particle could be at any point with equal probability.)</p>
            <p>As N (location/“humps”) increases, more and more smaller waves exist. So as <span class="math inline">\(N\rightarrow \infty\)</span>, there would be so many oscillations that it approaches the classical view</p>

            <p>As we know more certain its position (as L=&gt;0, position is well known (between 0 and L smaller)), the energy goes to infinity, which makes momentum quite uncertain.</p>
            <p>Visea versa.</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210322100851.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>

            <p>Outside of the box, the expotentials on the two sides would contain a stable velocity equaling to Q outside of the possible “existance” region.</p>
            <p><span>[</span><span>[</span>Pasted image 20210322102027.png<span>]</span><span>]</span></p>
            <p>Wave function is not 0 outside the box! According to quantum physics, there is some probability of finding the object outside its physical boundary box.</p>
