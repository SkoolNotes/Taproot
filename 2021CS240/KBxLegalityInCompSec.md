 ### The Robert Morris Internet Worm
 
 released a self replicating, self propogating worm which exploited the sendmail program
 slowed down a bunch of stuff, spread like wildfire
 he got convicted pretty hard

```ad-question
 why did he release it...?
 ```

#### Questions

1.  **What are the ethical choices people faced? What, if any, actions would you consider unethical? Why?**
	1.  Of course, Morris releasing the worm in first place was an ethical choice, but so was convicting him. Morris, even if just curious and not intending to hurt, still did hurt and acted irresponsibly. Thus, I would classify his choice as unethical. Those who convicted Morris had to do the same ethical classification I just did, and I have no reason to believe what they did was unethical. 
  
2.  **What, if any, actions in this story do you think should be illegal? What actions are actually illegal? Specify laws that might be relevant, even if no one was caught or prosecuted.**
	1.  Releasing the worm was illegal as it violated the computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Releasing the worm malware should most likely be illegal as it damaged others private property, but defining the group that should be illegal is a much harder task.
	
3. **What things do you think the people involved could have done to achieve their goals while staying within legal and ethical bounds?**
	1.  Morris's goals are quite unclear to me, besides just sheer curiosity about how his worm would fare in the real world. Satisfying this curiosity without releasing the worm into the real world is not an easy task. Morris could have tried to run some type of simulation, or fixed his program to make sure it didn't break machines then install a fail safe, but at the end of the day the question was about the real world and a true test. 

4.  **What would you consider appropriate punishment? If relevant to your story, how does that compare to the punishments that were handed down?**
	1.  The punishment given -- 3 years probation, 400 hours community service, and a fine of $10,050 -- seems a little much to me. Changing those 400 hours to having Morris prevent future attacks would be more reasonable given that he has proven himself to be capable of sending attacks. 
	
5. **What are the technical lessons that can be learned to improve security?**
	1. Communication networks between devices are scary and need to be checked closely lest more self-replicating worms wreak havoc.


### Silk Road


#### Questions

1.  What are the ethical choices people faced? What, if any, actions would you consider unethical? Why?
	1.  It's not entirely clear whether or not the Silk Road itself was ethical. It certainly seemed ethical to DPR and his libertarian followers -- they believed that each transaction was a "step toward universal freedom." Almost all the choices surrounding the Silk Road are thus ethical choices, from developing it to selling and bu
