# Rubric!
For this semester, I want to thrive to create systems that were reproducible, documented, and easy to use.

Foundational:
Comments and docstrings written to increase user understanding. README is created with basic, over-arching information of the product.

Proficient:
A perspective is paid to the ease of use and API of the product or service. More extensive comments and docstrings complement README to create a usable environment and package.

Exemplary:
Package created with extensive documentation, guidance in a format and size appropriate to the scale of the project; docstrings and comments complement and helps developers contribute to and interact with the codebase.
