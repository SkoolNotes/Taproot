#+TITLE: Threat Modeling Assignment
#+AUTHOR: Houjun Liu

The assignment is centered around [[https://www.condution.com/][Condution]], an open-source task management platform. Data processing and querying is done on-device, but raw user tables and data is stored in a remote PosgreSQL server that's either officially hosted and supported or optionally on-prem hosted by the user.

* What are we protecting?
Because of the open-source nature of Condution, and the fact that all data processing code is done on the client application
