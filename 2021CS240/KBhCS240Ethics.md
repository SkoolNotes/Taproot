# Ethics!
1.  What are the ethical choices people faced? What, if any, actions would you consider unethical? Why?
2.  What, if any, actions in this story do you think should be illegal? What actions are actually illegal? Specify laws that might be relevant, even if no one was caught or prosecuted.
3.  What things do you think the people involved could have done to achieve their goals while staying within legal and ethical bounds?
4.  What would you consider appropriate punishment? If relevant to your story, how does that compare to the punishments that were handed down?
5.  What are the technical lessons that can be learned to improve security?
