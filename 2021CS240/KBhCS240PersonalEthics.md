- Don't cause personal harm to self or others
- Plan everything, write everything down, detail all changes
- Disclose information responsibly with appropriate, official channels
- (from the original list) Don't act offensively for financial gain except where the act of an attack itself is agreed to by the proprietor of the system to directly bring financial gain under applicable law
- If something is in a gray zone, ask, research, until its not in a gray zone
- Don't hide information found unless the act of releasing it will break another rule
