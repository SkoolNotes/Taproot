title: Threat Modeling Assignment
---

The assignment is centered around
[Condution](https://www.condution.com/), an open-source task management
platform. Data processing and querying is done on-device, but raw user
tables and data is stored in a remote PosgreSQL server that\'s either
officially hosted and supported or optionally on-prem hosted by the
user.

# What are we protecting?

Because of the open-source nature of Condution, and the fact that all
data processing code is done with the client application, the most
important asset to actually protect is any user\'s data (tasks,
perspectives, due dates, etc.).

This means creating a secure pipeline between our servers and that of
the clients, that from self-hosted servers and that of their clients,
and finally the clients themselves.

The scope of Condution is has too narrow scope to protect anyone but
direct Condution user\'s data, including misuses of the client app or
API but not including users of a third-party services with indirect API
interfaces to Condution.

# Who are we protecting it from, and what are their motivations?

## Protecting from...

-   Advertisers who may want to advertise based on notes of users
-   Foreign companies and groups who are attempting to access privileged
    information
-   Bad actors looking to leverage a \"weak-point\" in a user\'s
    security profile
-   Well-meaning but security-unconscious users

## Not Protecting from...

-   Organized, state-supported exploits
-   Third party authorization and our hosting partners
