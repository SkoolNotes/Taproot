math time! 
```ad-important
- state problems clearly
	- find and display assumptions!
- iterate from simple -> real world
	- not pure math!
```

raking problem: 
- optimal way to rake a lawn


## day two?

apply math, not learn new math

10 big problems

5 have substantial write-ups
problem 10 we get to choose ourselvs
all in groups! 

we get to do computer sims!

```ad-def
modeling: translate something in the real world into mathematics
```

wont surpirse her if we use computer sims freqently
but they arnt the only thing in our answer
more readable than nns?

looking stuff up: don't look up how to solve the problem! can look up math concepts, but dont try to find someone else's solution
*duh*
