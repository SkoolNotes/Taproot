Step 1: Know what simple interest/compound interest is.

## Simple Interest Review

$P = principle$

$r = interest$

$t = time$ 

$SI = p \times r \times t$

##  Compound interest

$P = principle$

$r = interest$

$t = time$

$p = compounding\ per\ annum$

$CI = P(1+\frac{r}{p})^{tp}$

## E

$e = (1+\frac{1}{x})^x$
